636,State prepares for next chapter of wolves in West,Y,1/30/2007,Before,Great Falls Tribune,https://wwwproquestcom/docview/2061327063/pagelevelImagePDF/5476D669A7E34AFEPQ/77?accountid=14793&sourcetype=Historical%20Newspapers,Wolf Delisting AND Rocky Mountain,"Federal officials announced plans Monday to remove the gray wolf from the list of threatened and endangered species in the Northern Rocky Mountins. All but wiped out in Montana in the 1930s, wolves were added to the list in the 1970s. Their removal would turn management over to the states. Lynn Scarlet, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, called the comeback of wolves a ""major success for conservation achieved."" ""Wolves have met our recovery goals for them,"" she said. The plan covers 89 breeding pairs and 1,243 wolves in the Northern Rocky Mountains. Most of them are in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho. The recovery area also included portions of Washington, Oregon, and Utah. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said it hopes to finalize the proposal before the end of next year. The head of the wolf program in Montana said state officials were pleased Wyoming's disagreements with federal managers isn't holding up plans to turn over management to the states in Idaho and Montana. ""This sort of signals the next chapter for wolves out West."" said Carolyn Sime, wolf program coordinator for Montana Fish Wildlife and Parjs, which is maintaining conservation management long-term. State management will bring with it two majro changes, Sime said. First, hunting will be used to manage the population, just as it is for elk and deer and other wildlife. As long as there are 15 breeding pairs in the state, hunting will be allowed. ""That's our next homework assignment, Sime said. Second, the wolves around Yellowstone National Park are considered experiemntal because they were introduced to the area. Ranchers can haze and in some instances kill wolves if they are threatening or attacking livestock. Ranchers in northwest Montana, where wolves are listed as endangered, can't do that. Under state management, wolves in southern and northern Montana no longer would have a dual classification, Sime said. ""Upon delisting [Northwest Montana ranchers] will have the same ability to protect and defend their livestock,"" Sime said, Ed Bangs, head of the U.S. Fish and wildlife service's recovery efforts in the Northern Rockis, credited the recovery to wolves being  a ""tremendously adaptable animal."" Wolves have just one main threat, and that's people, Bangs said. That made recovery less complicated. ""It was just a single issue of not having people kill too many."" There are 13 breeding pairs and 159 wolves in northwest Montana, many of them living in and around Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness west of Great Falls. Wolves from Canada began recolonizing the area in the early 1980s. Today there are three packs in the Bob Marshall Wilderness. The Ref Shale Pack lives east of the Contnental Divide in the North Fork of the Sun River. There are two packs on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. Yellowstone National Park and the land around it has 371 wolves and central Idaho, 713. Wolves were introduced there in 1996 and 1997. The minimum recovery for the total Rocky Mountain population is 30 breeding pairs and at least 300 wolves for three consecutive years. Those benchmarks were attained in 2002. In Montana, the first statewide bounty law on wolves was passed in 1884. By the 1930s a self-sustaining breeding population was extinct. Federal officials said they would press ahead with removing the protective designation with or without an approved management plan from Wyoming. That state's plan would lead to excessive levels of human-caused mortality, according to the federal goverment. Plans already have been authorized in Idaho and Montana and state officials have been managing wolves for two years. Wolves in Glacier and Yellowstone would remain fully protected because they are in national parks. Defenders of wildlife, which runs a program in which ranchers are compensated for livestock losses to wolves, said management plans of Idaho and Wyoming are geared toward extinction. It said the states should take a cue from Montana, which the group said has a strong conservation-oriented management plan for wolves. ""Removing wolves from the endangered species list doesn't mean we can forget about them"" said the group's president Rodger Schlickeisen. ""If we do, the species will land right back on the list."" It also was announced Montay that the western Great Lakes population of gray wolves is being removed from the threatened and endangered species list. This isn't just a proposal. The population of about 4,000 wolves is located in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota.

USFWS Regional Director Mitch King responded to draft legislation proposed by Gov. Dave Freudenthal detailing the level of wildlife losses that would allow the state to kill the wolves blamed for the predation. ""It doesn't sound like they are totally out of whack."" King said. ""As I have said over and over again, wolves eat wildlife, and my biggest concern is we have about three and a half times more wolves than what is necessary for delisting,"" he said. ""If we can bring wolf populations back into synch... we can begin to address the state's concern."" The Fish and Wildlife Service announced a proposal recently to remove Rocky Mountain gray wolves from the endangered species list in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. But the agency also denied a request from Wyoming for permission to kill wolves to keep the animals from decimating wildlife herds while the delisting process occurs. If Wyoming won't join the delisting process, the federal agency has said it's prepared to remove federal protection for wolves only in the other two states and in national parks in Wyoming. Federal rules governing wolf management would have to be changed in order to accomodate Wyoming's plan to protect its wildlife.

Idaho will take over full management of the wolves on Friday as the US Fish and Wildlife Service ends a recovery effort that began when the animals were first reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho in the mid-1990sIts been a success story and we got more wolves in more places than we thought said Ed Bangs a Wildlife Service biologist who led the wolf recovery effort Delisting is the right thing to do and its the right time I might even have a glass of champagne on FridayAn estimated 1500 wolves now roam Idaho Montana and Wyoming Montana and Idaho have been handling the day-to-day management of their wolf populations for the last few years but the federal government didnt approve Wyomings plan until DecemberIn Idaho wildlife officials said no immediate changes would occur with delisting In Montana the change will give ranchers in the northern half of the state new authority to shoot wolves caught harassing or attacking livestock a power already held by ranchers in the states southern halfThe Wyoming Game and Fish Department has been preparing for a more significant overhaul spokesman Eric Keszler said That includes the hiring of four new wolf management officers and a public information campaign to educate the state about new wolf-hunting rules and the states dual classification systemThe animals will be a protected as a trophy species in the states northwestern corner and classified as a predator species in the rest of the state People will be able to kill wolves at any time and for any reason in the predator area which covers nearly 90 percent of the stateThats the most blatant and egregious expression of hostility in the state laws said Jenny Harbine a Bozeman Mont lawyer with Earthjustice a group fighting to retain Endangered Species Act protections for the wolvesBut federal officials said the relatively few wolves that roam into southern and southwestern Wyoming are routinely killed anyway because of their reliance on livestock for foodBiologically it doesnt really make any difference at all Bangs said But symbolically the idea of that is always going to be controversial We recognize that but our job is to look at the science of itSome wolves seeking to establish their own packs disperse out of the prime habitat of the greater Yellowstone area in midwinter and move into areas of southwestern Wyoming Bangs said When spring comes natural prey such as deer and elk move to higher elevations while the regions cattle and sheep provide easy targets for the wolvesIt ends up being a place that wolves just cant stay out of

recovery project leader for Wyoming The outlying packs tend to be small and temporary groups that dont reproduce he saidBangs said Wyoming is the only state to have adopted such a broad predator policy for wolves But he said other states have adopted liberal hunting or property-protection rules in areas that have lots of livestock and limited wolf habitatFor instance ranchers in southern Minnesota can shoot any wolf bothering their livestock Bangs said Bangs said Idaho has indicated that it will also adopt a liberal hunting policy in certain high-conflict areas and he expects Montana will do the sameEvery state thats done a wolf management plan has included that concept he said There are some places where wolves can live and other places where wolves cant be allowed to live because of conflictThats little consolation to Earthjustice which has given notice of its plan to sue the Fish and Wildlife Service next month on behalf of several environmental organizations Federal

Today some of those primal emotions are at play as ranchers and politicians bureaucrats and environmental activists work out the future of Canis lupus in the northern Rocky MountainsLike many contested issues involving wildlife this one is in federal court Federal agencies affected state governments and ranching and hunting interests say there are so many gray wolves in the Rockies now that its time to remove them from the list of endangered speciesWolf advocates say its too soon to do that and later this week a federal judge in Missoula Mont will decide how the case should proceedOnce totaling more than 350000 in the US West wolves were hunted and killed with more passion and zeal than any other animal in US history according to the US Fish and Wildlife ServiceAs their numbers dwindled toward extinction in the contiguous 48 states the gray wolf became protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1974As part of the federal recovery plan required under the ESA 66 Canadian wolves were set loose in Yellowstone National Park and part of Idaho in 1995-96 They formed up into breeding pairs and packs their numbers growing at more than 20 percent a year Today more than 1500 wolves range around Idaho Montana and Wyoming Some crossed the Snake River into OregonAs a result the government in March delisted northern Rocky Mountain wolves turning over wolf management to the three states The wolf population  has far exceeded its recovery goal and continues to expand its size and range said Deputy Secretary of the Interior Lynn Scarlett announcing the moveScientists are learning that wolves can have a beneficial impact on ecosystems But since the delisting in March theres been an upswing in wolf killing (at least 69) including the illegal shooting of a wolf in a protected area last weekTheres much greater public appreciation of the role of top carnivores says Louisa Willcox senior wildlife advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in Livingston Mont On the other hand the myth of Little Red Riding Hood just wont dieIts amazing the pockets of fear and irrationality that still pervade the wolf debate she says Plus the whole symbolic weight that wolves carry because they came in with the federal government  and not just that but the Clinton administrationIn many parts of the rural West the federal government controls much of the landscape (64 percent of Idaho) and Uncle Sam is seen as big brother imposing an environmentalist viewIt should be the people in Idaho deciding whether we have wolves or not says Rex Rammell a veterinarian former elk rancher and independent candidate for the US Senate seat being vacated by Larry Craig (R)A native Idahoan and lifelong hunter who lives in Rexburg Idaho Dr Rammell contradicts official reports in asserting that elk and moose herds in many places have dropped substantially due to wolves He also takes a strict state-rights position: All of these western states should have the land turned over to themUnder state plans some 500 wolves could be legally killed to reduce the population to around 1000 in the region But conservationists fear those plans in fact could reduce the total number to 300: That is 100 in each of the three states (the minimum required under the federal recovery plan) And some politicians are eager to do just thatIm prepared to bid for that first ticket to shoot a wolf myself said Idaho Gov Butch Otter (R) On the day of the delisting Governor Otter signed a new law allowing people to kill wolves without a permit whenever the animals are thought to be annoying disturbing or worrying livestock or other domestic animalsFollowing delisting Wyoming implemented a kill on sight predator law covering nearly 90 percent of the state outside of YellowstoneAntiwolf feeling is a matter of degree Only the most radical wolf opponents want to eradicate them and many ranchers have found ways to live with them A proposed ballot measure to get rid of all wolves in Idaho failed to get enough signatures recently Still 35000 people did sign the petitionTony Mayer head of Save Our Elk in Twin Falls Idaho says wolves should be managed to the level envisioned in the ESA listing  100 to 150 in Idaho instead of the 750 officially there now But he adds that that could not be accomplished by sport hunting alone and he worries that pro-wolfers have hijacked the ESAWe think wolves have a place in the wilderness he says citing evidence that there actually are 1000 wolves in Idaho now with annual population growth rates of 30 percent But we cant sit by and see the wolf population explode to the detriment of other wildlife he concludesA dozen environmental groups recently sued to reverse the federal delisting on the grounds that the Fish and Wildlife Services approval of state management schemes permits a level of wolf killing that radically diminishes the prospects for a functional northern Rockies metapopulation (A group of separated wolf packs that may interact is a metapopulation)The court is expected to rule May 29 on a preliminary injunction halting the delisting The US Fish and Wildlife Service sought to delay the case But in an order last week US District Judge Donald Molloy in Missoula wrote: The court is unwilling to risk more [wolf] deaths by delaying its decision on plaintiffs motion for preliminary junctionScientists say reintroducing wolves has led to ecosystem benefits Thinning of overpopulated elk in the Yellowstone area for example has helped rejuvenate overbrowsed plant speciesWriting in the journal Biological Conservation researchers William Ripple and Robert Beschta at Oregon State University in Corvallis say theyve documented the first significant growth of aspen in over half a century in Yellowstone Wolves appear to represent a key component in helping to passively restore these complex and wild ecosystems they writeThis has made rivers and streams healthier leading to better habitats for beaver songbirds and native trout Wolves also have reduced the coyote population and improved the health of elk and deer herds by removing diseased animalsRecent advances in population genetics have led other scientists to conclude that the reduced numbers outlined in state plans for wolf management could lead to inbreeding and genetic deterioration Biology professor Robert Wayneat the University of California Los Angeles has concluded that 300 wolves in the region severely underestimates the number required for a healthy wolf metapopulation as he stated in a letter to the US Fish and Wildlife Service More than 250 other scientists signed a similar letter to the agency and several studies conclude that 2000 wolves are needed to maintain the speciesBut opposition to increasing (or even maintaining) wolf numbers is fierceLivestock have been killed by wolves and hunters fear that the wolves return threatens game animals as wellBut state game agencies report that elk populations are at or above population management objectives Hunters in Wyoming killed 22635 elk last year 1542 more than the year beforeMany times more cattle and sheep are killed by coyotes vultures or domestic dogs (or stolen by rustlers) than are lost to wolves says the National Agricultural Statistics Service Between 1987 and 2005 528 cattle and 1318 sheep were confirmed lost to wolves and 396 wolves were legally shot by ranchers or killed by government control efforts according to the US Fish and Wildlife ServiceSince 1987 the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife has maintained a

373,EDITORIAL: Judge explain why F&G cant manage wolves in Idaho,Y,7/23/2008,Before,McClatchy - Tribune Business News,https://uwyoidmoclcorg/login?url=https://wwwproquestcom/usnews/wire-feeds/editorial-judge-explain-why-f-amp-g-cant-manage/docview/464647865/sem-2?accountid=14793,Wolf delisting AND Idaho,Heres a modest proposal for US District Judge Donald Molloy who on Friday put Canadian gray wolves back on the federal endangered species list in Idaho Montana and Wyoming: Let Idaho manage the states wolf population until it demonstrates it cant Molloy based in Missoula Mont granted a preliminary injunction that will put wolves back under federal management That decision also means Idaho Montana and Wyoming will have no wolf hunt this fall. Hailey-based Western Watersheds Project and 11 other environmental groups asked for the injunction against delisting in hopes of allowing the wolf population to continue expanding The plaintiffs argued that state management plans are inadequate to ensure long-term conservationMolloy decided the environmentalists would likely prevail based on wolf advocates claim that wolves in Yellowstone National Park were not genetically mixing with other wolf populations He also criticized the Wyoming plan left 90 percent of the state open for year-round wolf kills Yet the judge said the Montana and Idaho plans were good enough to protect wolves at least as well as the federal rules in place when the wolves were delisted. So  why did he take management away from the two states?Idaho estimated it would have a spring population of 1063 wolves and authorized a hunting that would have allowed killing of as many as 428 The hunt would end once the overall mortality limit was metWestern states have been down this road before of course having the rules of resource management changed by a judge after the legislative and administrative processes produced a decisionSomething similar is now taking place with Northwest salmon recovery And its happened before on public land grazing allotments across southern IdahoIt seems that if you cant successfully make your case to Congress simply find a lawyer skilled at filing injunctions. The irony is that Idahos wolf population would probably be better off with Fish and Game managing it The Idaho agency knows the resource has long experience in balancing healthy wildlife populations and is motivated to make wolf delisting workStill Molloys ruling -- which he is free to turn into a permanent injunction -- has little to do with Idahos and Montanas competence to manage wolves It has everything to do with halting wolf huntingWestern Watersheds and the other environmental groups are like a baseball team that never loses a game because the manager excels at talking the umpire into extra innings,Idaho Montana Wyoming Endangered Species List  De-listing Wolf Gray Wolves Hunting,Public/Private,Anonymous,Let Idaho manage the states wolf population until it demonstrates it cantYet the judge said the Montana and Idaho plans were good enough to protect wolves at least as well as the federal rules in place when the wolves were delistedSo  why did he take management away from the two states?It seems that if you cant successfully make your case to Congress simply find a lawyer skilled at filing injunctionsThe irony is that Idahos wolf population would probably be better off with Fish and Game managing it The Idaho agency knows the resource has long experience in balancing healthy wildlife populations and is motivated to make wolf delisting workStill Molloys ruling -- which he is free to turn into a permanent injunction -- has little to do with Idahos and Montanas competence to manage wolves It has everything to do with halting wolf huntingWestern Watersheds and the other environmental groups are like a baseball team that never loses a game because the manager excels at talking the umpire into extra innings

to Glacier National Park could be caught in the cross-fire of state-sponsored wolf hunts- and that killing could begin in just a few weeksThe decision couldnt come at a worse time Breeding season is here and wolves will start giving birth in April That means pregnant females and newborn pups will be among those gunned downA Defenders of Wildlife press release similarly claims delisting allows for the killing of nearly two-thirds of the regions wolvesAccording to the 2008 interagency report at least 1645 wolves live in Idaho Montana and Wyoming Idahos plan calls for maintaining at least 500 of its estimated 846 wolves Montana agrees to keep at least 400 of its 497 wolves Hunting will occur in both states to help regulate the populations None of Wyomings 302 wolvesincluding those in Yellowstone National Park- could be legally killed as theyll remain under federal protectionSo delisting in Montana and Idaho will not aflea the Yellowstone Park wolves or any of the wolves in me Greater Yellowstone area in Wyoming says Bangs and no one is suggesting there will be anything but a very limited and highly regulated fair chase- ie no aircraft or snowmachine- hunting in Montana and

Bangs says but the environmental groupss recent fabrications could potentially hurt their cause I think they risk their credibility because theyre just saving stuff that isnt true he saysLouisa Wilcox NRDCs senior wildlife advocate in Livingston Mont calls her groups claims legitimate The Idaho and Montana management plans contain no language binding the states to the 900-some wolves they say theyll keep she argues only to 15 breeding pairs each or about 150 wolves So the assertion that 1000 wolves could the comes from the only binding standard in the delisting rule she saysThats true Bangs acknowledges but only under a theoretical worst-case scenario thats basically impossibleYou can do the math and make it appear like a horror show- crying wolf so to speak- but really thats not what the states have committed to Bangs saysWilcoxs concern comes mostly from Idahos approach to wolf management which stands out as far more aggressive than Montanas The Idaho Department of Fish & Game seeks to kill an undetermined number of wolves in the Lolo elk management zone within northern Idahos Clearwater region- which borders Missoula County- to reduce pressure on elk herds That hunt does not hinge on delisting however Recent revisions to an Endangered Species Act rule known as 10(j) provide for such population control if the state can prove predators are a major cause of declining ungulate numbers Delisting would only make it easier to greenlight the huntThats the area were immediately concerned with this spring says Wilcox who contends about 120 Clearwater-area wolves are at risk But Jim Unsworth Fish & Game deputy director says theres zero chance of a hunt there before fall rebutting the urgency of environmental groups fundraising appealsImpending massacre or not Sime says environmental groups lobbing grenades from the sidelines as she puts it only sets back collaborative approaches to wolf management She argues mat Montanas track record at least deserves some level of trust in a debate that has both sides ultimately fighting for the same thing- responsible state managementHard decisions are made everyday to create capacity for wolves on the

and Wildlife Service on Wednesday formally called for removing gray wolves from the endangered list in Montana and Idaho while maintaining federal protections in Wyoming a decision that drew promises of lawsuits A separate agency rule calls for removing federal protections for wolves in the western Great LakesThe agencys filing confirms Interior Secretary Ken Salazars announcement last month that he would uphold the decision to leave the wolves under federal management in Wyoming Publication of the formal delisting rule in the Federal Register which officially occurs today served mainly to open the floodgates of litigation over the issue Parties who object may file notices of intent to sue starting todayWyoming Attorney General Bruce Salzburg said the state will sue the Fish and Wildlife Service over the new rule because it denies Wyoming management Meanwhile the Natural Resources Defense Council and other environmental groups said they will also sue over their contention that federal protections are inadequateWe know were going to be in litigation over this whole thing said Ed Bangs wolf recovery coordinator with the US Fish and Wildlife Service in MontanaWolf management in the western Great Lakes hasnt spawned as much controversy as it has in the Northern Rockies The federal government has approved wolf management plans crafted by Minnesota Michigan and Wisconsin There has been some litigation over the plans but they enjoy considerable support from conservationists in those statesSalazars announcement last month that wolves would be removed from the endangered list in the region opens the door for the three states to allow hunting as well as killing of wolves that go after livestock and petsAn estimated 4000 wolves roam the three states including 600 to 700 in northern and central Wisconsin Bounty hunting had nearly wiped wolves out in Wisconsin by the late 1950s but the animals migrated back from Minnesota after being placed on the federal endangered species list in the 1970sThe Fish and Wildlife Services Northern Rockies wolf rule covers Wyoming Idaho and Montana the eastern one-thirds of Oregon and Washington and parts of northern UtahWyoming has been pushing for years to bring wolves under state management It proposes to classify them as predators that could be shot on sight in most areas while leaving them to be managed as trophy game in the greater Yellowstone areaMany Wyoming ranchers are concerned about wolves preying on livestock while hunters in the state dont like competition from wolves for elk and mooseSalzburg said Wednesday that the state plans to file suit in federal court in Wyoming He said the state objects to the Fish and Wildlife Service seeking to raise the number of wolves it wants the state to accommodateThe Fish and Wildlife Service needs to make its decisions based solely on science as opposed to what we think are political and public relations concerns that in our view dont have a place in a listing or delisting decision Salzburg saidThere are about 1645 in the northern Rockies Bangs said including more than 300 in Wyoming nearly 500 in Montana and about 850 in IdahoSalzburg said the federal government has been telling Wyoming Idaho and Montana for years that they need to aim for 15 breeding pairs and at least 150 wolves per state However the federal rule published this week would specify that Wyoming should maintain at least seven breeding pairs and 70 wolves outside of Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parksThe Fish and Wildlife Service has waffled in recent years on whether to turn over wolf management in Wyoming to the stateThe federal agency accepted Wyomings management plan in late 2007 clearing the way for delisting about 1500 wolves in the Northern Rockies early last year However environmentalists sued over that delisting effort saying it didnt offer wolves enough protectionUS District Judge Donald Molloy in Montana ruled in favor of the environmental groups last summer The judge ruled that the state management plans were insufficient to protect the wolves and leveled particular criticism against Wyomings planBangs of the Fish and Wildlife Service said its clear that Wyoming needs to classify wolves as trophy game animals throughout the state and manage them the same way it manages bears and mountain lions He said the state cant allow wolves to be killed indiscriminatelyDoug Honnold a lawyer with Earthjustice in Montana represented the coalition of environmental groups that shot down last years wolf delisting proposal He said the coalition will kick off a new lawsuit in federal court in Montana this week challenging the new federal delisting planWe dont think were at recovery yet Honnold said Wednesday And were going to fight until we can get to legitimate recovery We think that the population is close to appropriate recovery levels but its not there yet,Wyoming Montana Idaho Wolf De-listing Endangered Species List,Executive,Ed

of an estimated total of 1343 - of the wolves in Idaho and Montana to be killed These numbers do not even account for the new pups being born as we speak who are easy targets for those who would wish them harmThe delisting plan ignores current science on what wolves need to maintain a healthy population over the long term It also ignores the hundreds of thousands of citizens who have asked for a better plan and it flies in the face of the fact that wolf populations cannot be distinguished on the basis of political boundaries for the purpose of applying the ESAWith respect to Idaho and Montana little about this rule has changed since it was rejected and deemed unlawful in a federal court in July of 2008 Idaho which hosts the majority of the regions wolf population has already publically announced its desire to aggressively reduce its state wolf population once federal protections are lifted Today there are at least 25 packs on the short-list that may be targeted for removal It is actions such as these that we fear and must preventDelisting the wolf at this point in time completely undermines the serious work consideration and cooperation among all stakeholders that is necessary before being able to objectively declare the gray wolf recovered,Idaho Montana Gray Wolves Wolf De-listing Recovery Protections NGO,NGO,Rodger Schlickeisen Defenders of Wildlife President ,Todays delisting is a potentially disastrous turn for a venture that began in 1995 in such a hopeful and rewarding manner: the restoration of wolves to their natural landscape in the West We are outraged and dismayed that Secretary Salazar put his stamp of approval on this premature and inadequate Bush administration plan for wolfWe all expected more from the Obama administration which repeatedly promised it would consult with conservationists scientists and other stakeholders on key issues before making decisions Secretary Salazar rejected our offer to work with him to find the right way to delist wolves in the region and instead made his surprise announcement that he was removing federal protections for vulnerable wolves with no transparency at all Defenders of Wildlife immediately filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act so we could learn who the Secretary talked to about the issue and what scientific review he undertook -

Idahos 2008 hunting seasons initially called for the removal of up to 362 wolves before federal courts stepped inThe US Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services has also pinpointed at least 25 chronic wolfpacks in Idaho -- those deemed to be consistently predatory upon domestic livestock And the agency is pushing hard to completely remove eight or nine of those packs this spring before federal lawsuits are filed at the beginning of June said a source within Idaho Fish and Game DepartmentFor some people that would only be a good start Ron Gillett frontman for an Idaho group calling itself the anti-wolf coalition has said Idaho has four times the approximately 800 wolves state and federal officials say exist in the state and called the wolf a wildlife terroristOn the other end of the spectrum are environmental and wolf-protection groups who say there are not yet enough wolves to maintain the population if wolf-hunting seasons are instituted throughout the Northern RockiesFinally theres Washington The states only varified pack an extended family group of eight wolves found last year in the Methow Valley is believed to have already have lost one and maybe two of its members to illegal killings and authorities are investigating whether they were killed by Twisp residentsBut with the federal delisting and the states wolf management plan just sitting there in the words of one of the citizens appointed to help produce it the possibility of Washington having a viable wolf population in the foreseeable future becomes very slimWe spent all this time working on it and now we have nothing said working group member John Blankenship a former USFWS regional deputy directorSince we dont have a wolf management plan if (wolves) lose their status the games over as far as wolves are concerned They dont have any protection,Endangered Species List Montana Wyoming Idaho De-listing,Executive,Ed Bangs a US Fish and Wildlife Service Wolf Biologist,Clearly wolves no longer need the protection of the Endangered Species Act and its time to move them to a better conservation model which is state-based management said federal gray wolf recovery coordinator Ed Bangs Clearly the biology is rock solid Wolves are fully recovered

last year FWP wildlife managers are proposing to create 14 wolf hunting units and will ask the commission to consider overall harvest quotas of 186 and 216 wolves Commissioners approved a harvest quota of 75 wolves across three wolf management units for the 2009 seasonIn a word its all about balance said Ken McDonald FWPs chief of wildlife Smaller and more wolf management units represent lessons learned from the 2009 hunting season Some areas contributed more to the harvest than expected and prevented us from addressing management needs in other areas We want to adjust that to ensure a widely distributed harvest and yet still target areas where were seeing impacts on prey like elk and deer and where recurring livestock depredations are anticipatedThe FWP Commission will meet Thursday May 13 in the old Supreme Court Chambers on the third floor of the Montana State Capitol in Helena beginning at 8:30 amIn addition subquotas are proposed in three areas to limit harvest

predicted 439 wolves living in packs at the end of 2010 A harvest quota of 216 is projected to reduce the wolf population to 403 wolves living in packs or by about 20 percent These projections include anticipated reductions due to livestock depredation and mortalities from other events like accidents and natural causesMcDonald noted that the proposed harvest alternatives carry specific tradeoffs We believe both options are in line with our wildlife management responsibilities he said The lower quota of 186 wolves moves us at a slower management pace while a quota of 216 wolves allows us to move a bit more rapidly to address the wildlife and livestock depredation issues that are occurring In both cases we know these quotas are conservative and in line with what we think will be viewed as reasonable proposals We need to hear how the commission and public feel about the pace and the associated tradeoffsThe public will have an opportunity to comment on any proposal approved by the commission The statewide meetings to discuss the proposals will be held June 2 The public comment period is expected to run through June 14 A final decision on the wolf season and quota is set for July 8For the 2010 wolf hunt northwestern Montana would have a total of nine wolf management units with a total quota of 122 or 133 wolves; western Montana would have two management units with a total quota of 26 or 31 wolves; and the three proposed management units in the southwestern portion of the state would have a total quota of 38 or 52 wolves Eastern Montana is included in hunting units as wellMontanas approach to wolf management continues to be balanced scientific and measured McDonald said Weve learned a lot over the past year and our proposals for 2010 reflect a rigorous science-based effort to manage the total number of wolves that can be taken by hunters while maintaining a balance among all wildlife their habitats and the people who live here That balance will include managing for a recovered wolf population while addressing livestock depredation and impacts to other wildlife Its our responsibility to address the fact that more than 200 sheep and about 100 head of cattle were killed by wolves last year and that wolves have depressed deer and elk populations in some areasLast year during Montanas first ever regulated wolf hunt hunters harvested 72 wolves between Sept 15 and Nov 16 As hunters approached the overall harvest quota of 75 wolves FWP closed the hunt about two weeks before the season was scheduled to end to ensure the quota would not be exceededMcDonald stressed that FWP will continue to monitor the wolf population before during and after the hunting season to determine how the population respondsWolf hunting season dates would generally correspond with the opening of Montanas big game hunting seasons All wolf hunting would close Dec 31 if quotas arent reached earlier Hunting licenses will cost $19 for residents and $350 for nonresidents License sales should begin in AugustOfficials caution however that the wolf hunting season could be blocked by groups that recently sued the US Fish and Wildlife Service to prevent wolf delisting Such legal challenges prevented wolf delisting and a hunting season in 2008 and could affect the wolf hunt this year FWP has joined the USFWSs defense of the delisting decision Court arguments are set for June 15 in Missoula The recovery goal for wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains was set at a minimum of 30 breeding pairs--successfully reproducing wolf packs--and a minimum of 300 individual wolves for at least three consecutive years This goal was achieved in 2002 and the wolf population has increased every year since The northern Rockies metapopulation is comprised of wolf populations in Montana Idaho and Wyoming Today about 1700 wolves with about 115 breeding pairs live in the region where wolves can travel about freely to join existing packs or form new packs This combined with wolf populations in Canada and Alaska assures genetic diversityIn Montana officials estimate that at least 524 wolves in 101 verified packs and 37 breeding pairs inhabited the state at the end of 2009Delisting allows Montana to manage wolves in a manner similar to how bears mountain lions and other wildlife species are managed guided completely by state management plans and

more wolf management units represent lessons learned from the 2009 hunting season Some areas contributed more to the harvest than expected and prevented us from addressing management needs in other

The court sided with Defenders of Wildlife and other conservation organizations that sued to restore federal protections. The following is a statement by Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife: ""This decision is a significant victory for wolves, for the integrity of the Endangered Species Act, and for all Americans who care deeply about conservation. The court's ruling makes it clear that decisions under the Endangered Species Act should be based on science, not politics. ""We all need to work together to craft responsible state management plans for wolves that allow for healthy, interconnected wolf populations now and in the future. For that to happen, regional recovery goals will need to be updated based on the best available peer reviewed science. ""Secretary Salazar's support of the Bush administration's proposal to remove protections for wolves was premature and clearly inconsistent with the law. Had the federal government prevailed in the lawsuit, real wolf recovery would have been set back for perhaps decades. Worse, the precedent of the federal government making listing and delisting decisions for endangered species based upon political boundaries rather than science would have crippled the Interior Department's future management of the Endangered Species Act to the detriment of many species. The faulty effort by the administration to delist has set back legitimate delisting by some time. ""We are eager to work cooperatively with all stakeholders to find a way forward to ensure continued recovery of wolves in the Northern Rockies and their eventual delisting."" The following is a statement by Suzanne Stone, Northern Rockies representative with Defenders of Wildlife: ""While we are pleased by the restoration of federal protection for wolves, the court's decision demonstrates the problems inherent in the federal government's current delisting scheme. We need a new approach. We need a federal delisting plan that establishes a healthy, interconnected wolf population and adopts stakeholder-driven solutions to the current conflicts. It's time to move beyond the gridlock over wolves. We are, as always, willing to work with the other stakeholders to seek solutions and a more rational, science based wolf delisting plan. ""Defenders of Wildlife has a long record of being responsive to the livestock community's concerns, and we plan to continue that and to expand our ongoing proactive conservation work to minimize conflict between wolves and livestock owners, so there can be a place for wolves and livestock to co-exist on the landscape. Our work to date has shown that collaboration is possible when parties meet each other halfway. And we are willing to work with the states and other stakeholders to ensure that wolves and other imperiled wildlife are managed based on sound scientific principles.""
Background:
Wolves were eradicated from the region by the 1930s as part of an overall campaign to eliminate many of the native predators. With the adoption of the Endangered Species Act in 1973, efforts began to restore the Northern Rockies wolf population. Wolves dispersing across the Canadian border into northern Montana in the 1970s and 1980s were the first to return to their historic habitat in the region. By 1995, that population had grown to 60 - 70 wolves. To expedite wolf recovery, in 1995 and 1996 the US Fish and Wildlife Service captured 66 wolves from Canada and released them in central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park. Since that time, wolf numbers have increased to approximately 2,000 wolves in 2009, the same number that many biologists have estimated would be necessary for maintaining a recovered wolf population. However, that same year, Idaho and Montana initiated hunting seasons which reduced the wolf population down to 1650 wolves by the end of 2009. One immediate effect of today's court ruling will be to cancel a second wolf hunting season in Montana and Idaho, which was set to begin this fall and would have decreased the population to even lower levels. State agencies will still be able to manage wolves, including removing problem wolves implicated in livestock conflicts or causing unnatural declines in game species.",Montana Idaho Endangered Species List  Endangered Species Act Hunting Protections Recovery Gray Wolves NGO,NGO,Rodger Schlickeisen Defenders of Wildlife President ,This decision is a significant victory for wolves for the integrity of the Endangered Species Act and for all Americans who care deeply about conservation The courts ruling makes it clear that decisions under the Endangered Species Act should be based on science not politicsWe all need to work together to craft responsible state management plans for wolves that allow for healthy interconnected wolf populations now and in the future.

Commission passed a resolution during a Monday meeting finding fault with a court ruling to re-list wolves as an endangered species and vowing to pursue all legal options to restore state authority over managementAccording to the resolution the commission hopes to work with Gov CL Butch Otter to reach a memorandum of agreement with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to once again establish Idaho as having the lead role in managing relisted wolvesThey had an MOA prior to wolf delisting that basically turned over much of the day-to-day management of wolves to the state explained Toby Boudreau regional wildlife manager When wolves became delisted the MOA was kind of a moot point We had the daily management of wolves in its entiretyDuring the meeting at the regional headquarters in Idaho Falls the commissioners also advocated for an appeal of the Aug 5 ruling by US DistrictJudge Donald Molloy in Missoula  Mont placing wolves back on the endangered species list The appeal would be heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Commissioners said they will cooperate with both the governor and the congressional delegation in pursuing federal legislation to correct the Aug 5 federal court decision re-listing wolvesThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of 13 environmental groups who noted no other endangered species has ever been delisted at such low population levels and then subjected to hunts starting immediately afterward The US Fish and Wildlife Services delisting rule allowed Idaho and Montana to reduce the wolf population to 150 wolves per state which would represent a two-thirds loss in populationThe Fish and Game resolution stressed that restrictions will be enacted on the use of Idaho Department of Fish and Game funds for wolf enforcement and other purposesWe sold 29000 wolf tags last year That probably did help with enforcement and management of wolves Since we cant have a hunting season we dont have that money coming in anymore  Boudreau saidAccording to the resolution  The commission will proceed to set a hunting season and harvest limits as soon as wolves are delisted based upon the existing rules previously established for public hunting in IdahoThe commission however  noted the doors may still be open to a hunt despite the re-listingThey are going to seek a hunting season through the Endangered Species Act process Boudreau saidAccording to the commission  the re-listing of wolves is contrary to state management of wildlife the intent and purpose of the Endangered Species Act and the clear biological recovery of wolvesThe commission reviewed three broad options for management of wolves while they are relisted: No active state management continuing in the lead role for wolf management and or keeping only limited management under the supervision of the US Fish and Wildlife Service the resolution reads The commission fully considered the limited management authorities available to Idaho while wolves are re-listed  and we confronted the difficult choice of either having full responsibility for wolf management with little authority to address conflicts or leaving entirely in the hands of our federal government the fate of our ranchers  pet owners sportsmen and others who are hurt by the decline in elk and other wildlife caused by wolf predationThe regional director for the US Fish and Wildlife Service out of Portland also attended the meeting to offer an update on wolf management after Molloys rulingSuzanne Stone a Boise representative for Defenders Wildlife called the resolution predictable amid a perpetual tug of warIf both sides invested as much energy into resolving the conflict I think wolves would be delisted sooner rather than getting caught up in court over and over again Stone said We have another opportunity to work together from both sides and try to resolve the conflict There seems to be an almost 100 percent focus on winning the conflict as opposed to resolving itStone agrees with Molloy that the delisting process as it occurred violated requirements to delist the population as a territory rather than state by state and she believes the delisting plan would have jeopardized the wolf population in the regionThe original recovery goal when wolves were introduced into the Rocky Mountain region in 1995 was at least 300 wolves The Fish and Wildlife Service estimated there were 1706 wolves in the region by the end of 2009 including 843 in IdahoAbout 35 people attended the Monday commission meeting including a member of Sen Mike Crapos office Boudreau said the August meeting is typically hosted just to set the hunting seasons for waterfowl and sage grouse as well as to set fishing limits for the fall Chinook seasonThey also completed that business

plans to alter its stance on wolf management -- classifying the animals as predators that can be shot on sight across most of the state -- despite a court ruling that Wyomings position means wolves

click below for a full report from AP reporter Ben Neary in CheyenneWyoming officials not inclined to act on wolvesBy BEN NEARY Associated Press WriterCHEYENNE Wyo (AP) -- Wyoming remains committed to classifying gray wolves as predators that can be shot on sight across most of the state despite complaints that its position will stop hunting seasons in neighboring Idaho and MontanaUS District Judge Donald Molloy of Missoula Mont early this month rejected the US Fish and Wildlife Services move to turn over wolf management to Idaho and Montana while leaving them listed as an endangered species in WyomingMolloys decision blocks wolf hunts that Idaho and Montana had planned for this fallAnd ironically Molloys decision also effectively leaves Wyoming -- whose wolf management plan the judge excoriated two years ago -- in the position of controlling wolf management in the entire Northern Rockies at least for nowWyoming has stubbornly opposed the federal wolf reintroduction effort since it began at Yellowstone National Park in mid-1990sBut now unless Wyoming backs off on its plan to declare an open season for wolves in most of the state the other states wont get to hold the controlled wolf hunts they want to protect livestock and keep their wolf populations steadyAnd Wyoming is not about to agree to change its planGov Dave Freudenthal a popular Democrat now in the final months of his second and final term said this week that Montana Gov Brian Schweitzer and Idaho Gov CL Butch Otter havent bothered to ask him whether Wyoming intends to reconsiderIt may be that theyve known me long enough that Im not going to change my position Freudenthal said of the other governorsFreudenthal also brushed off as overly critical a newspaper column that Assistant US Secretary of Interior Tom Strickland wrote this month knocking Wyomings positionThe courts decision clearly shows that for the gray wolf recovery requires Wyoming to change its policy Strickland wrote in the Los Angeles Times If Wyoming were to join its neighbor states and develop a wolf management strategy with adequate regulatory mechanisms on human-caused wolf mortality including hunting all three states would benefitFrustration over Wyomings position is also widespread in Idaho and MontanaMontana wolf program biologist Carolyn Sime said residents in her state believe they did everything right and are frustrated that Wyoming can hold them backIt does not make sense for us that the actions and wishes of another state prevent something in our state Sime said Wyomings past prevents Montana from moving forward That doesnt seem fair to usYet Freudenthal and others in the state emphasize that the Fish and Wildlife Service itself helped the state write its wolf management plan in early 2008 and approved it at the time Only after Molloy criticized Wyomings plan in late 2008 did the Fish and Wildlife Service repudiate it delisting wolves only in the other two states while leaving Wyoming behindWyoming has its own federal lawsuit pending in US District Court in Cheyenne challenging the Fish and Wildlife Services refusal to delist wolves in the stateWyoming officials say their plan would assure enough wolves survive to maintain at least 15 breeding pairs and 150 total wolves in the state -- the minimum number the Fish and Wildlife Service has said each of the three states needs to maintain There are now more than 1700 wolves in Idaho Montana Wyoming and parts of Oregon and Washington stateTheres little desire among Wyoming lawmakers to change the states wolf management plan Many openly say they dont trust the federal wildlife agencySen Bruce Burns R-Sheridan is chairman of the committee that hears wildlife issues He said the state should wait and see what happens with its own lawsuit and said he doesnt see any reason the state should feel pressured to change its positionIts unclear whether Wyomings lawsuit will be judged moot in light of Molloys ruling Bruce Salzburg Wyoming attorney general said the state would object if the federal government tries to dismiss the states caseDoug Honnold a lawyer with Earthjustice in Montana represents a coalition of environmental groups that successfully argued against delisting wolves in the other states while leaving protections in place in Wyoming He said he believes theres a strong argument that Wyomings lawsuit should be dismissed as mootClearly Wyomings intransigence has created all kinds of different problems for the Fish and Wildlife Service and for Montana and Idaho I dont think theres any doubt about that Honnold said But I think there are lots of different courses to get to recovery and Im hopeful that Wyoming will see the light about the importance of being involved in this recovery and delisting of wolves rather than try to obstruct itWhatever happens Honnold said its clear that Wyoming cant be left out of the process this timeThe law says that if a species is endangered in any significant portion then the species or the population in this case needs to be listed Honnold said So somehow Wyoming has to be part of the picture,Wyoming De-listing Wolf Montana Gray

Fish & Wildlife Service finalized a rule removing protections for all gray wolves in the lower-48 states except for a small population of Mexican wolves in Arizona and New MexicoThe rule proposed last year outraged Americans with approximately 18 million comments submitted by the public opposing delisting Additionally 86 members of Congress (in both the House and Senate) 100 scientists 230 businesses and 367 veterinary professionals submitted letters opposing the wolf delisting plan Even the scientific peer reviews commissioned by the Fish and Wildlife Service itself found that the agencys proposal contained numerous errors and appeared to come to a predetermined conclusion with inadequate scientific support Despite this public and scientific outcry the rule issued today removes all federal protections from gray wolvesDr Jane Goodall founder of the Jane Goodall Institute & UN Messenger of Peace shared this video this morning in response to the announcement The video is allowed to be sharedWatch video here: https://youtube/J6QnAgV2TsEThe following are statements from a coalition of organizations that work toward wildlife conservation:This is no Mission Accomplished moment for wolf recovery said Kristen Boyles Earthjustice attorney Wolves are only starting to get a toehold in places like Northern California and the Pacific Northwest and wolves need federal protection to explore habitat in the Southern Rockies and the Northeast This delisting decision is what happens when bad science drives bad policy -- and its illegal so we will see them in courtWolves are too imperiled and ecologically important to be cruelly trapped or gunned down for sport said Collette Adkins Carnivore Conservation Director at the Center for Biological Diversity The Trump administration is catering to trophy hunters the livestock industry and other special interests that want to kill wolves Well do everything we can to stop itThe decision to remove critical protections for still-recovering gray wolves is dangerously short-sighted especially in the face of an extinction crisis We should be putting more effort into coexistence with wolves instead of stripping critical protections still needed for their full recovery The science is clear that we need to be doing more to protect nature and wildlife not less said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael BruneWe are disappointed in the US Fish and Wildlife Services final determination to remove federal protections for the gray wolf in the lower 48 states states Angela Grimes CEO of Born Free USA With current gray wolf habitats spanning states that are hostile towards the species gray wolves still teeter on the verge of recovery Delisting this American icon appeases a small percentage of the American public and will surely damage the viability of future populationsWithout the protections afforded by the Endangered Species Act gray wolves would never have recovered in the places where they are now said Leda Huta Executive Director of the Endangered Species Coalition By removing protections across the country the Trump administration is abandoning efforts to restore this iconic American species to millions of acres of wild habitatProtecting and restoring the iconic call of the wolf is our duty to not only the populations of wolves that continue to be persecuted to this day but to the ecosystems that depend upon them Removing protections for wolves under the Endangered Species Act ensures that these much-maligned creatures will continue to struggle for their rightful place in the natural world  stated Louie Psihoyos Founder and Executive Director of Oceanic Preservation Society As we confront the 6th Mass Extinction we must work to defend every living component to maintain natures complex and delicate balanceWolves are just beginning a tentative recovery in states like Washington Oregon California and Colorado and the howl of the wolf is completely absent from their natural habitats in states like Nevada and Utah said Erik Molvar a wildlife biologist and Executive Director of Western Watersheds Project Removing Endangered Species Act protections before wolf populations are secure and before their recovery is complete is ecologically irresponsibleBy turning over gray wolf management to the states the Fish and Wildlife Service is relying on local management regimes that often undermine gray wolf recovery efforts said Cathy Liss president of the Animal Welfare Institute Many of the states wolf management plans are vague and unenforceable lack sources of funding and prioritize recreational hunting interests over the maintenance of viable wolf populations Gray wolves are apex predators who play a vital role in ecosystems contribute to a multibillion-dollar outdoor tourism industry and are a beloved symbol of our nations wildlandsWhere wolves are unprotected they are mercilessly persecuted as weve already had a glimpse of in Wyoming Idaho and Montana  said Lindsay Larris Wildlife Program Director at WildEarth Guardians Now they are defenseless across their range which is bad news for wolves but good news for people who want to shoot and trap them The Trump administration is once again destroying our shared natural resources for the interests of a fewStripping protections for gray wolves is premature and reckless said Defenders of Wildlife President and CEO Jamie Rappaport Clark Gray wolves occupy only a fraction of their former range and need continued federal protection to fully recover We will be taking the US Fish and Wildlife Service to court to defend this iconic speciesIf we want to save wolves we need a national plan if not a continental one said Environment Americas Conservation Program Senior Director Steve Blackledge Wolves need plenty of space to roam and it just doesnt make sense to create arbitrary boundaries for them Do we really want to lose the hearty howl of the gray wolf on our watch?You cannot have a national wolf recovery without putting forward a national wolf recovery plan This still has not happened so eliminating federal protections for gray wolves is a huge setback in recovery efforts said Sylvia Fallon Senior Director Wildlife for the Natural Resources Defense Council Wolves are still missing from much of their remaining habitat in the West and throughout the Northeast As we face a biodiversity crisis of global proportions now is the time to restore species to the landscape -- not dial back efforts Unfortunately the Trump administration has decided on the exact oppositeThe many threats that caused wolves to become endangered still exist said Nancy Warren Executive Director National Wolfwatcher Coalition States have shown over and over again that wolf management is based on politics rather than science The cumulative effects of interpack strife aggressive hunting and trapping practices legal and illegal killings car collisions and disease impact not only wolf populations but also the social structure of packs well beyond the extent of each individual threatOnce large carnivores lose federal protections the states often open liberal hunting and trapping seasons purposely depleting populations said Garrick Dutcher Research and Program Director for Living with Wolves History shows this to be especially true for the gray wolf whose recovery is underway but nowhere near complete There is no biologically sound reason to lessen or remove protections for wolvesThe return of the wolf reflects more fully functional and wild ecosystems said Wolf Conservation Center Executive Director Maggie Howell While we agree that wolves cannot be recovered everywhere they used to be found there is still plenty of suitable habitat left in areas where wolves have yet to recover Vast swaths of existing highly suitable habitat in the Southern Rockies parts of West and the Northeast will now remain forever impoverished by reduced biological diversity and impaired ecosystem healthWolves are only recovered in 15% of their range at best stated Camilla Fox Founder and Executive Director of Project Coyote Only anti-wolf bias and certainly not credible science would conclude that 15% constitutes a significant portion of wolves historic range This completely contravenes the notion of evidence-based policy or science-based wolf recoveryGiven that gray wolves in the lower 48 states occupy a fraction of their historical and currently available habitat the Fish and Wildlife Service determining they are successfully recovered does not pass the straight-face test said John Mellgren an attorney with the Western Environmental Law Center On its face this appears to be politically motivated While the Trump administration may believe it can disregard science the law does not support such a stance We look forward to having a court hear our science-based arguments for why wolves desperately need Endangered Species Act protections to fully recoverRestoring endangered species is much more than a minimum population numbers game stated David Parsons Carnivore Conservation Biologist at The Rewilding Institute The first purpose of the ESA is to restore ecosystems that are critical to the recovery of endangered species Gray wolves are keystone species in their ecosystems and removing their protection under the ESA will forever preclude them from re-inhabiting significant areas historically occupied habitats leaving these areas ecologically impoverishedUntil all wildlife voices are weighted equally and the state agencies inhumane and unscientific management plans are changed to reflect real Wisconsin values on wolf conservation and independent research then the wolf hasnt truly recovered Endangered species conservation begins and ends with managing and educating people Delisting would essentially throw the wolf back into the hands of the very same attitudes and practices that caused their extinction in Wisconsin said Melissa Smith director of Great Lakes Wildlife Alliance and Friends of the Wisconsin Wolf & WildlifeEntrusting states with gray wolf management is a brutal and failed experiment said Kimberly Baker Executive Director of the Klamath Forest Alliance Idaho serves as a horrific example where 60% of the states wolf population including dozens of pups were exterminated in a single year destroying decades of wolf recovery effortsDelisting will cause wolves to fall prey to the whim of state governments led by boards disproportionately represented by hunting/trapping interests said Karol Miller President of The 06 Legacy This conflict of interest is without consideration of the positive role of wolves or the need for sufficient populations to fulfill their role as a critical keystone species in a healthy ecosystemThe northeast has been totally ignored by state and federal governments despite the fact that it contains tens of thousands of square miles of potentially suitable wolf habitat abundant prey and is as near as sixty miles to existing wolf populations in Canada according to John Glowa President of The Maine Wolf Coalition Inc Furthermore recent evidence indicates that wolves have returned to the region This keystone predator is an essential part of the ecosystem in the northeast where deer populations are exploding and where moose are lacking natural predators Stripping federal protection will doom natural wolf recolonization and will ensure that the ecosystem is never returned to its natural stateWolves are one of the most highly persecuted species in North America and the humans that came before us did a remarkable job of eliminating these carnivores from our landscapes said Wildlands Network Conservation Director and Interim Executive Director Greg Costello We now recognize the ecological need for wolves and must continue to uphold the inherent right of this species to coexist in the worldThe US Fish and Wildlife Service has once more shown its blatant disregard for the values of the majority of Americans who care deeply about wolves and dont want to see them killed for the pleasure of a few trophy hunters said Sara Amundson President of Humane Society Legislative Fund This politicized decision by the Trump administration throws away decades of science-based recovery efforts and is based on the same fearmongering and hate that caused the extirpation of wolves a hundred years ago Well never give up fighting to secure their permanent protection from such wanton cruelty and destructionWolves are among the essential wildlife for healthy resilient ecosystems especially during these times of chaotic climate change In addition wolves are also valued by many Americans for their intrinsic worth as co-inhabitants of the Earths wildlands Kim Crumbo Wildlands Coordinator The Rewilding InstituteRemoving protections for gray wolves amid a global extinction crisis is short-sighted and dangerous to Americas conservation legacy said Bart Melton Wildlife Program Director for the National Parks Conservation Association Rather than working alongside communities to support the return of wolves to parks and surrounding landscapes including Dinosaur National Monument North Cascades and Lassen National Forest the administration essentially today said good enough and removed Endangered Species Act protections The Fish and Wildlife Services proposal ignores the requirements of the Endangered Species Act science and common senseThe gray wolf is a keystone species that plays a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems across its historic range said Danielle Kessler US Country Director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare Wolf populations are far from recovered in much of their native territory Removing federal protections now and placing wolves in the hands of state managers only threatens already fragile gains No state has the breadth of vision to oversee recovery efforts for species that range beyond its boundaries For the sake of our shared environment as well as the health and survival of gray wolves themselves federal protections remain essential for this iconic American speciesHowling For Wolves is adamant in our opposition to wolf trophy hunting and trapping We have witnessed how wolf hunting and trapping harms the wolf population Human wolf killing destroys the individual wolf which is a magnificent and social animal and these killings cause other secondary wolf deaths Research shows that human wolf killing disrupts wolf packs causing unstable and unpredictable effects including increased wolf-livestock conflicts said Howling For Wolves President and Founder Dr Maureen Hackett,Idaho Montana Wyoming De-listing Endangered Species Act Wolf Gray Wolves Recovery Protections Hunting,NGO,Kristen Boyles a lawyer with Earthjustice,This is no Mission Accomplished moment for wolf recovery said Kristen Boyles Earthjustice attorney Wolves are only starting to get a toehold in places like Northern California and the Pacific Northwest and wolves need federal protection to explore habitat in the Southern Rockies and the Northeast This delisting decision is what happens when bad science drives bad policy -- and its illegal so we will see them in court

In March 2009 Secretary Salazar approved removal of wolves from the Endangered Species List Idaho and Montana scheduled hunting seasons and 350 wolves nearly 20 percent of the total population in both states were killed A coalition of 13 groups seeking to put wolves back on the Endangered Species list challenged Salazars wolf delisting decisionA federal court in Montana overturned Salazars decision August 5 Federal District Judge Donald Molloy ruled that wolf populations must be managed as a whole and not by arbitrary political boundariesIn October Idaho Governor Butch Otter called a halt to the states wolf management program On October 18 the governor notified Secretary Salazar that Idaho no longer will act as the federal governments designated agent managing wolves imposed on the state under the Endangered Species ActThat means the Idaho Fish and Game agency will no longer perform statewide monitoring of wolves conduct investigations into allegedly illegal killings of wolves provide law enforcement in response to allegedly illegal takings of wolves or implement the livestock depredation response program Governor Otter said Instead the Idaho Fish and Game Commission has refocused its efforts on protecting Idahos deer elk and moose and the Department of Fish and Game will apply to the Interior Department for additional flexibility in addressing wolf depredation issues so Idaho can exercise its sovereign right to protect our wildlife said the governorWith the August federal court decision that reinstated Endangered Species Act protection for wolves in the Northern Rocky Mountains federal law now guides Montanas management of the states wolf population As a result of the decision which Montana has appealed the line that once divided Montanas wolf population as a nonessential experimental population in the southern half of the state and an endangered population to the north has been reinstated by the court Different federal regulations apply in the two areasOfficials with Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks called the recovery of the wolf in the northern Rockies one of the fastest endangered species comebacks on recordIn the mid 1990s to hasten the overall pace of wolf recovery in the Northern Rockies more than 60 wolves were released into Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho The minimum recovery goal for wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains was set at a minimum of 30 breeding pairs and a minimum of 300 individual wolves for at least three consecutive years This goal was achieved in 2002 and the wolf population has increased every year since Another federal judge ruled in November that the US Fish and Wildlife Service was not justified in rejecting Wyomings wolf management planUS District Judge Alan Johnson ruled that the federal agencys insistence that Wyoming list wolves as a protected trophy game species throughout the state was arbitrary and capricious and should be set asideJudge Johnson directed the federal agency to revisit whether Wyomings proposed trophy game management area in the states northwest corner is adequate to maintain a healthy wolf population or whether the states proposed boundaries should be expanded The states plan would allow unregulated killing of wolves in all but the northwest corner of the state Currently all of Wyomings wolves are listed as a federally endangered species so it is illegal to kill wolves anywhere in the stateLast year at this time the wolf population in the Northern Rocky Mountain Recovery Area which encompasses parts of Montana Idaho and Wyoming was estimated to be at least 1706 with 242 packs and 115 breeding pairs About 525 wolves were estimated to inhabit Montana in 100 packs and 34 breeding pairsNevertheless the nonprofit Republicans for Environmental Protection said Thursday that it is too early to remove the gray wolf from the Endangered Species List Referring to both wolves and grizzly bears Jim DiPeso REP Americas policy director said Northern Rockies states have not demonstrated their willingness to manage these species post-removal to ensure their continued health On the contrary both wolves and grizzlies face irrational animosity from officials in those states In 2007 for example Idaho Governor CL Butch Otter told a rowdy rally that wolves should be hunted down to an unviable remnant population of 100 animals Wildlife managers must strive for science-based ecologically oriented goals said DiPeso Wolves and grizzly bears play vital roles regulating ecosystems within their historic ranges With that Greenwald of the Center for Biological Diversity agrees Wolves are a keystone species that benefit prey populations by culling sick animals and preventing overpopulation he points out Studies of wolves reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park show that they also benefit other species including pronghorn antelope and foxes by controlling coyote populations and songbirds and beavers by dispersing browsing elk and allowing recovery of streamside vegetationThe Department of the Interiors failure to develop a national recovery strategy for the wolf as it has for other species like the bald eagle

the 37-acre Stipek fishing access site on the Yellowstone River north of Glendive for $164000; and the 1-acre Scotty Brown Bridge property adjacent to the Blackfoot Clearwater Game Range for $97000I think its important to note that we have a mix of the kinds of purchases we made Schweitzer said In many cases like when we purchase fishing access sites theyre not large pieces of land but are critical pieces of land so more people can access our rivers And in some cases they are small and medium size purchases that create conduits to much larger pieces of public land for public recreationFWP Director Joe Maurier said a unique set of circumstances has allowed his agency to buy the properties -- Plum Creek Timber Co sold off hundreds of thousands of acres including land near the federally owned Bob Marshall and Scapegoat wilderness areas; the 2007 Montana Legislature approved dedicating $10 million in general funds for property acquisition through the Access Montana program; and three new federal habitat programs started in the mid 2000s have provided FWP with around $30 million to purchase wildlife habitatWe could leverage money and had built up some reserves then had an opportunity that came up with some conservation groups  and the stars aligned Maurier saidYet now that FWP owns 348700 acres across Montana in 72 wildlife management areas 44000 acres in 53 state parks and almost 21000 acres at more than 320 fishing access sites the budgets for weed control sanitation and staffing are stretched thin The head of the FWP Parks Division Chas Van Genderen recently told the FWP Commission that his division is in a terrible fiscal situation and asked for permission to raise fees at some of the state parks The commission refused the request last month citing the national economic downturnMaurier said he doesnt have a dollar figure for the maintenance backlog and while he agrees that the state parks system isnt adequately funded he downplays concerns that maintenance is overwhelming and strongly defends the purchasesOur philosophy in going into this whole thing was that where we had good opportunities that werent just throwing money away for places where we really needed access -- special places -- that we would act now and at the very worst case we might have to mothball them awhile to do necessary things to open them to the public Maurier saidA report by the Legislative Fiscal Division adds that its often difficult to determine what has been spent on maintenance for FWP lands due to a variety of accounting practicesFor example to determine how much has been spent on weed control statewide the amount expended on supplies or contracts can be isolated but not often the corresponding personal services costs the report states However expenditures are not an adequate means to measure weed control activities as paying for weed control and actually controlling weeds are two different thingsUnder a 2009 statute money for maintenance has to be included in the purchase price But the statute expires in 2013 and the fiscal division report adds that the active land purchasing by FWP coupled with the relatively flat figures set aside for maintenance creates an imbalance between the amount available for maintenance and the requirements of the expanding systemIn the Parks Division alone while the total fund balance remained positive expenditures exceeded revenues by $14 million in fiscal year 2008 and by $755000 in 2009 reducing the fund balance by $21 million Those expenses arent tied to any one line item but the trend is expected to continue unless changes are madeMaurier said theyre asking the Legislature for permission to increase the voluntary fee people pay when they license their vehicles from $4 to $6 The governors biennial budget proposal also includes an increase of 48 percent for the state agency from $140 million to $146 million but the money isnt necessarily dedicated to maintenanceIn these tight fiscal times Republican legislators have asked departments to cut their budgets by 5 percent; the impact may not be as great in the FWP Department since it typically doesnt receive general fund money Most of its budget comes from license and recreational fees federal funds and the state bed taxMaurier said FWP may have to delay opening some sites and continue to defer maintenance elsewhere until the system catches up with itselfWell do the best we can and eventually everything will be open Maurier said Our parks system is not funded very well so we are going to see if people are willing to pay a little moreAt a recent natural resources subcommittee meeting Barbara Smith with the Legislative Fiscal Division added that the lack of balance for acquisition and management of land has been an issue for at least the past three sessions and continues todayWe have had a lot of requests to look at state land purchases Smith said adding that the queries include land bought by other state agencies too Its a series of issues -- what should the state hold what should FWP hold what is the relationship with trust lands and who controls the acquisitionsWhile Maurier and his staff can recommend buying land those property purchases or donations need the approval of the five-member FWP Commission Those involving more than 100 acres or $100000 in value also need the go-ahead from the five-member State Land BoardSince the Legislature last met in 2009 the Legislative Fiscal Division identified maintenance of FWP lands for public safety resource protection and facility performance as a critical goal for the agency during the next two years However the division also pointed out that proposed budget cuts could result in reduced grants to local communities for trail maintenance as well as delayed maintenance activities in state parks and fishing access sitesWith more than $15 million in donated land lowering the average cost to about $392 an acre no one is accusing FWP of any malfeasance In fact many conservation and sporting groups applaud the purchases and work with FWP to increase state holdingsI think the state has been thoughtful in their purchases; its not like theyre just buying land anywhere said Kat Imhoff state director of The Nature Conservancy Her organization purchased many of the Plum Creek Timber Co lands and held them until state or federal agencies found the money to buy them or they were sold to adjacent landowners with some restrictionsFolks from community groups were so concerned about losing access they had for so long from Plum Creek and thats a huge driver for the state Imhoff said This is impressive in terms of making opportunities for future generationsBut state Sen John Brenden R-Scobey a former rancher who previously was an FWP commissioner is asking pointed questions about land purchases and maintenanceHow much is enough? If we cant manage what we have why do we keep buying land especially in this economy? Brenden said Then as a rancher Im bidding against myself as a taxpayer Its unfair competition I want to make things work not kill FWP but they need to control their spending Its easy to spend other peoples moneyMaurier has heard the arguments before but said that during the past two years hes been at the FWP helm people throughout Montana have told him their No 1 priority is access to hunting fishing and recreational areasThe bottom line is this land belongs to all Montanans to our grandchildren and the children that are yet to be born Maurier said We can have a philosophical debate about whether the government owning land is appropriate or not  but we have decided this is important to do and were stretching our funding by buying at the low end of the market with tough bargaining and maximizing federal dollarsMaurier said FWP pays taxes on the land and recently dropped the Parker Homestead as a state park because it was too small to provide many opportunities for the public But while some legislators have pushed for no net gains in state lands he said the outcry is overwhelming whenever his agency tries to sell off some of the isolated smaller parcelsWhen the commission attempted to do that a few years ago there was a huge push back from constituents not wanting to give up any land regardless Maurier said I think you would face that same sentiment today although Im willing to look at thatHe noted that on the average 243000 people hold hunting licenses and 391000 people have fishing licenses State parks have recorded about 2 million visitors annually and a 2010 economic impact study recently released reported that nonresidents who visited state parks contributed $122 million to Montanas economy and produced 1600 jobs last yearWe have made some remarkable investments for the sportsmen of Montana Maurier said Most important is the Plum Creek land which is prime habitat for a variety of species and can serve as connecting corridors which are critical for any (grizzly bear and wolf) delisting opportunities down the road It preserves public access to those places where weve had it for years that we were going to lose,Montana De-listing Endangered Species Act,Executive,Joe Maurier Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks Director,We have made some remarkable investments for the sportsmen of Montana Maurier said Most important is the Plum Creek land which is prime habitat for a variety of species and can serve as connecting corridors which are critical for any (grizzly bear and wolf) delisting opportunities down the road It preserves public access to those places where weve had it for years that we were going to lose

livelihoods of Idaho families More than 2000 head of cattle sheep and dogs in Idaho have been confirmed killed or injured by wolves since 2003 Idaho should be permitted to manage its wildlife populations including sport harvest of wolves The best solutions to natural resource concerns are often obtained by those closest to the issue We will continue to work collaboratively with Idahoans the state tribes federal government and our colleagues in Congress for a locally-driven solution that returns management to the state

136,CONSERVATION AT A CROSSROADS,Y,3/27/2011,During,Bozeman Daily Chronicle,https://uwyoidmoclcorg/login?url=https://wwwproquestcom/usnews/newspapers/conservation-at-crossroads/docview/858712794/sem-2?accountid=14793,Wolf Delisting AND Montana ,In 1964 an unnamed Montanan traced his finger on a map around what Congress had just established as the Bob Marshall Wilderness in northwestern MontanaThats it the man told a New York Times reporter It has been pretty well explored for minerals but you never can tell when somebody might try something again Lets hope nobody can touch it now Its something that should have been done a long time agoThose were heady times for the American environmental movement In the decade following passage of the 1964 Wilderness Act -- the first legislation of its kind in the world -- Congress also passed the Clean Water and Endangered Species acts and created the Environmental Protection Agency All those measures passed Congress by near-unanimous votesAround the same time Montanans ratified a new state constitution that guaranteed citizens rights to a clean and healthful environment and the Montana Legislature passed the Montana Environmental Protection ActwasThis is now: No new wilderness has been designated in the state for 30 years Polls show Montanans want environmental laws weakened And Congress has to date been unwilling to act on what is arguably the most-pressing environmental issue of the day: climate change courts have prompted lawmakers to take aim at the very laws that the environmental groups used to sue in the first place One bill in Congress would target logging lawsuits by mandating thousands of acres of forest be loggedAnother would strip wolves of endangeredspecies protection no matter how small the wolf population getsPeople inside and outside the environmental movement agree it faces serious challenges But where some see those challenges as symptoms of larger issues -- more money in politics or more polarization in Congress -- others see a clear need for the environmental movement to change tactics or face serious consequencesIn 2009 as Montana embarked on its firstever fair chase wolf hunt a Defenders of Wildlife video advertisement played over and over on a jumbo screen in New York Citys Times SquareIt showed footage of wolf pups playing in a verdant field with an ominous message beneath: Wolf families are threatened They are being killedThe video gave viewers a number they could text to donate $5 to the group to help it bring a lawsuit along with 13 other groups to block the federal governments decision to take the wolf off the endangered-species list in Idaho and MontanaThe ad campaign was successful Defenders said as was the lawsuitBut both may have undercut the effort by triggering a congressional backlash and advancing what critics call a flawed strategy of appealing to coastal sensibilities when taking stands on Rocky Mountain issuesThe green groups are listening to the majority of their membership and I think theyre being pushed in a direction where local political sentiment is a lower priority or a casualty said Bill Schneider founder of the Helena-based outdoorsguidebook Falcon Press and a syndicated columnistSchneider has been critical of the environmental movement in recent years saying it is pushing its luck with unbending stances on everything from wilderness to wolvesIn 1995 when wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park nobody could dispute that they were endangered he said Few could argue that the grizzly bear was in danger of going extinct when it was listed in 1975 eitherHowever as both those animals populations have grown to numbers biologists say are healthy the public has become skeptical of legal efforts by environmental groups to keep the species on the list -- and possibly of the Endangered Species Act itselfThats part of my pitch of why they blew it Theyre giving the Endangered Species Act such a bad rap that it takes a lot of backbone for a federal official to declare anything endangered Schneider saidAnd it is not just wolves stirring the ire of public officialsIn 2009 US Sen Jon Tester D-Mont unveiled his Forest Jobs and Recreation Act which would create more than 550000 acres of wilderness in southwest Montana but would also mandate logging 70000 acres of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest over 10 years When he introduced the bill Tester made it clear the logging provisions were aimed at environmental groups he claimed were unduly stymieing timber projects and logging jobs through lawsuits While many environmental groups have gotten behind the proposal others are wary of the prospect of the precedent set by mandating logging on public landsIn a similar vein the Montana Legislature is advancing a bill that would make it more difficult for people to sue under the Montana Environmental Policy Act -- the states landmark environmental law And a recent poll conducted by Lee Newspapers found that 53 percent of Montanans support loosening state law to encourage more mineral extractionSome environmentalists contend that the anticonservation rhetoric is part of a natural swing of public opinion albeit a more extreme swing than usualI used to think of it like a pendulum said Steve Kelly a Bozeman man who helped found the Alliance for the Wild Rockies Now its like a metronome and someone keeps pushing the weight down The swings are coming closer together and are more intenseBut Kelly also said he looks at more than just wilderness designation when measuring his groups successI feel like we protected the roadless areas for the species he said What weve got it just doesnt have an official protection label When I started there were 64 million of roadless lands Some of it has gotten away from us but not that muchBut others contend the movement has lost momentumLiz Shanahan a Montana State University political science professor has studied the narratives the environmental movement uses to gain support for its causes People need emotional investment in causes she said and fear of environmental catastrophe was once a powerful motivatorHowever she argued the public is no longer responding to that tacticThe Chicken Little sky-is-falling narrative has worn on the public she said The environmental narrative has to change if they want to be successful Watching the polar bear as the symbol of climate change is not workingIn Montana she said the movement also has to contend with the bad taste left behind by the wolf warsThe original success of the wolves has cost the environmental movement a lot of political capital she said Its emptied their bank accountWhile making no apologies about the Greater Yellowstone Coalitions effort to keep the wolf on the endangered species list that groups executive director

were plenty of people who didnt have a problem with wolves but they were tired of the battle going onWhile the 1960s and 1970s saw watershed moments for the environmental movement those decades also saw environmental catastrophes unlike anything the United States now knows: a river in Ohio catching fire a town in northwest Montana blanketed in asbestos revelations that the common pesticide DDT may be wiping out Americas raptorsThe environmental movement was not born out of contention It was Yeah we have pollution said MSUs ShanahanAnd conservation groups in Montana have had plenty of victories in recent years with broad support Mineral leases adjacent to Glacier National Park have been retired and hundreds of thousands of acres once owned by the Plum Creek Timber Company put under conservation easementsThe same poll that showed Montanans wanted more mineral extraction also showed even stronger support for renewable energy Matt Skoglund a wildlife advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Livingston was hopeful todays challenges could spark new enthusiasm in the movementWithout a doubt both at the state level and the federal level there are a lot of attacks

Idaho,Conservationists are angered and disappointed by the deal struck between Congress and the Obama administration to authorize the federal budget for the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year Protection for clean water for wild lands and for endangered wolves will be lost if the continuing budget resolution is enacted as it now standsCongress will vote this week on the resolution that keeps the federal government in business through SeptemberWater quality programs under the US Environmental Protection Agency account for about 26 percent of cuts to the federal budget under the continuing resolutionThe latest agreement between Congressional leaders and President Obama decimates water protections said Wenonah Hauter executive director of the nonprofit Food and Water WatchThe budget agreement for the six month fiscal year 2011 Continuing Resolution announced yesterday includes a $997 million cut to the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds as compared to FY2010 and a $797 million cut as compared to the Presidents FY2011 request Hauter explainedThe ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to help municipalities deliver clean water to US citizens has been seriously threatened with cuts to the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds the mechanism by which the federal government dispenses funds for the upkeep of our tap water and sewerage systems Hauter saidIf Congressional leaders were looking for budget savings they should have looked elsewhere said Hauter If they were aiming to gut the EPA they moved a step closer to accomplishing their goal todayThe continuing resolution also includes a provision that bars the Interior Department from spending any money on implementing the Obama administrations Wild Lands policy announced in DecemberLabyrinth Canyon proposed wilderness in Utah (Photo by SUWA)The resolution would prohibit funds from being spent to implement administer or enforce Interior Secretary Ken Salazars order to designate new federal areas as wild landsRepublican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska today said she backs the budget resolutions provision Congress has sole authority to create new wilderness areas Any attempt to try an end run around Congress will get a predictable response said Murkowski the ranking Republican on the Senate Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee Moving forward I would encourage the Interior Department to work not around but with CongressBut Richard Peterson-Cremer legislative director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance called the provision a stunning show of disrespect for the last remaining magnificent wild lands in Utah and throughout the WestThe Interior Departments Bureau of Land Management had operated under a similar policy for 27 years says Peterson-Cremer until 2003 when the Bush administration signed off on a secret deal that disavowed its authority to protect wilderness-quality lands After the deal BLM operated as if there were only one resource it could not manage and protect: wildernessAt stake now are millions of acres of Utahs redrock wilderness that the Bush BLM acknowledged contain wilderness values but declined to protect warned Peterson-Cremer Many of these acres were on track to gain increased protections from oil and gas drilling and off-road vehicle damage that had been authorized by the Bush-era BLM Now that progress is threatened as Big Oil and other wilderness foes in Congress pressure the White House to trample our wilderness heritageFederal endangered species protections for wolves are also swept away by the budget resolutionSenator Jon Tester a Montana Democrat and Congressman Mike Simpson an Idaho Republican placed a rider on the budget bill that removes wolves in Montana Idaho Washington Oregon and Utah from the federal endangered species list and sets the stage for near-term delisting in WyomingApproved by both the Democratic and Republican leadership the rider bans citizens from challenging the wolf delisting decision in court while preserving anti-wolf litigation brought by the state of Wyoming and othersKieran Suckling executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity said In the 38-year history of the Endangered Species Act Congress has never intervened to override the law and remove a plant or animal from federal protectionTesters rider is not only a disaster for wolf recovery it opens the door for every self-interested politician to try to strip protection away from local endangered species said SucklingWell fight this rider to the bitter end but the chances of killing it are slim especially since the rejection of our legal settlement with the Department of the Interior took away our only leverage to rally senators against the rider Suckling saidOn April 9 a federal judge rejected a settlement agreement that would have sidetracked the wolf controversy by staying a previous court order; maintaining protection for wolves in Washington Oregon and Utah; establishing an independent science panel on wolf recovery in Montana Idaho and Wyoming; and preserving the right of citizens to challenge future wolf delisting decisionsThe delisting rider would leave the 1270 wolves in Montana and Idaho without federal protections at the mercy of states that have declared they want to exterminate wolvesSenator Tester who chairs the Congressional Sportsmens Caucus said today Right now Montanas wolf population is out of balance and this provision will get us back on the responsible path with state management Wolves have recovered in the Northern Rockies By untying the hands of the Montana biologists who know how to keep the proper balance we will restore healthy wildlife populations and we will protect livestock This provision is best for our wildlife our livestock and for wolves themselvesBut Andrew Wetzler director of the Natural Resources Defense Councils Wildlife Conservation Program is not persuaded This is a huge setback for one of Americas greatest conservation success stories and a significant blow to the Endangered Species Act he said today Leaders from both parties are completely undercutting the basic principle of American wildlife conservation: that science should dictate which plants and animals will be protected not the whims of politiciansCongressional leaders rightly recognized that the riders undercutting health and environmental protections in the House of Representatives were inappropriate for a budget bill said Wetzler This anti-conservation rider is no differentDefenders of Wildlife President Rodger Schlickeisen said State legislatures in the Northern Rockies continue to prove why state management of wolves is a cause for concern he said today For example the Idaho legislature has passed a bill authorizing the governor to declare a state of emergency over the presence of wolves and extremists in that state are calling for law enforcement to find and kill these amazing

The legislation contains important language that moves forward negotiations on the status of the gray wolf in Wyoming and includes a provision that defunds the Administration's misguided Wild Lands policy. Lummis released the following statement: ""For many years, Washington turned a blind eye while it accumulated massive amounts of debt to the detriment of future generations of Americans. I came to Washington to cut up the government credit cards and eliminate the threat that Washington's irresponsible spending poses for our country. Folks in Wyoming and people from every corner of our nation want and deserve a government that is accountable and responsible with their hard-earned tax dollars. ""Although not perfect, this bill represents the beginnings of positive change to Washington's reckless spending culture. Congress is moving in the right direction with the near $40 billion in cuts. But a lot of heavy lifting remains. I'm eager to continue the momentum into FY2012 with the GOP budget blueprint, 'The Path to Prosperity,' a serious plan that saves trillions of dollars and gets to the business of paying down America's unsustainable debt. "" Representative Lummis voted in favor of resolutions within the budget to defund the implementation of ObamaCare and prohibit federal dollars from going to Planned Parenthood. On H.R. 1473's wolf delisting language: ""Language included in H.R. 1473 removes a significant roadblock that would have otherwise stood in the way of the development of an approved state management plan. Wyoming has faced many bumps in the road when it comes to the status of the fully recovered gray wolf in our state. Successfully defending Judge Johnson's ruling in favor of Wyoming's wolf management plan is imperative to advancing meaningful discussions. Although much work remains, I believe we are on our way to the ultimate goal of a full delisting of the gray wolf in Wyoming."" On H.R. 1473's language prohibiting the Department of the Interior (DOI) from using taxpayer money to fund the Wild Lands policy: ""Defunding the Administration's brazen land grab is an important victory for the West. Western communities were completely left in the dark when the Administration overstepped its authority and placed severe limitations on public lands with this unwelcome initiative. I am pleased taxpayer money will be denied to this proposal which would have had serious repercussions for jobs and the Western way of life.""
Background:
H.R. 1473 will provide funding to keep the federal government running for the remainder of the fiscal year.

Suckling said Jon Testers job creation agenda is concerned with only one job -- his own With the help of the White House and Senate leader Harry Reid he has sacrificed wolves and the Endangered Species Act to cynical self-interested politicsTester however brushed off the criticism saying that Congress has taken action on individual species like when it forced the Department of Interior to adopt new rules that were more protective of polar bearsAs to whether the rider was politically motivated Tester said hes more concerned with doing the right thing than getting re-electedAnybody who comes to the US Senate with a mind toward re-election is doomed to make a lot of bad decisions Tester said I saw the wolf population at 1700 I saw the decimation of livestock and wild game and quite frankly knowing that wolves are at the top of the food chain and are fully recovered and have to be managed thats why I put this bill forward This is about doing whats right and this is the right move to makeGov Brian Schweitzer also praised the moveI welcome the delisting of the wolf in Montana through this budget resolution Schweitzer said This is a common-sense measure that will ensure good management of wolves through Montanas existing plan which allows for healthy numbers of wolves and safeguards the interests of ranchers and sportsmen I appreciate Sen Testers efforts to shepherd this resolution through Congress for the benefit of all MontanansWolves once were common through the West but were hunted and poisoned to near extermination in the early 1900s in the Rocky Mountains They were reintroduced in the greater Yellowstone Park area beginning in 1995 and today about 1700 roam the West,Montana De-listing Endangered Species Act Gray Wolves,Executive,Montana Gov Brian Schweitzer ,I welcome the delisting of the wolf in Montana through this budget resolution Schweitzer said This is a common-sense measure that will ensure good management of wolves through Montanas existing plan which allows for healthy numbers of wolves and safeguards the interests of ranchers and sportsmen I appreciate Sen Testers efforts to shepherd this resolution through Congress for the benefit of all Montanans

beginning in the Northern Rockies wolf sagaBy summer the gray wolf will again be taken off the Endangered Species list in Montana and Idaho the result of Congress attaching a rider to budget legislation directing Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar to remove protections in these two states and parts of Utah Oregon and WashingtonThis decision returns daily management to Montana and Idaho meaning a great deal of work lies ahead for the states wildlife agencies and governorsThe battles over gray wolves have been among the most controversial in this region in years The public on both sides of the issue is fully engaged Americans who cherish wildlife will be watching closely to see how both states choose to manage wolves over the next decadeSince wolves were restored to Greater Yellowstone and central Idahos wilds 16 years ago Montana and Idaho have insisted they can manage them Now both will have the opportunity to show the nation they can ensure healthy enduring populations for the long-term Wyoming where wolves remain protected under the ESA will not be allowed to follow the examples of Montana and Idaho until it produces a viable management planGYC will closely monitor state management We will work with agencies and local stakeholders to make sure wolves are managed like other wildlifeThis includes fair-chase  regulated hunting as an important management tool Likely starting this fall hunters will be able to legally harvest wolves in the two states If fair-chase hunting is conducted with a full component of sound science and public involvement  we believe wolves will continue to fill their ecological niche on the landscape in both statesWhat has often been lost in the heated controversy over state vs federal management is the fact that wolf recovery in Greater Yellowstone and the Northern Rockies is an incredible success story --perhaps the most successful restoration of a species in Americas 100-year effort to improve wildlife managementTwenty years ago no wolves existed in Greater Yellowstone Today almost 1700 roam the Northern Rockies --500 in Greater Yellowstone alone --and ecological balance is being restored to our wildest landscapes through the presence of wolves and their interactions with other animalsAlong the way some communities near Yellowstone National Park have learned how to economically benefit Studies show wolf-watchers add $355 million annually to their coffers from increased tourismAt the same time wolves have had a negative impact on some ranching and farming families due to predation of livestock and pets In some valleys wolves also have contributed to changes in distribution and populations of elk and deer This in turn has angered hunters who treasure the presence of large herds for sport and foodAddressing these conflicts --which are real and important --will require the entire wildlifemanagement toolbox from research on populations to monitoring for the presence of wolves to reducing livestock conflicts using non-lethal techniques to fair-chase hunting and to lethal control by wildlife managers responding to cattle and sheep predation We believe wolves will be resilient and adaptable even in the face of intervention by agencies to reduce numbers through hunting or lethal-control methodsWe have encouraged managing for 1200-1 500 wolves across the Northern Rockies and with delisting the three states are committed to 1100 We intend to hold them to thatIf the total population does drop drastically below these levels the ESA will almost certainly be used to return numbers to a sustainable population Most residents --including GYC and its members --dont want to see that happen againGYC has for years strived to find the middle ground on wolf management  to move beyond ongoing conflicts by using science-based management to monitor the impacts of wolves and to ensure public understanding of the vital role these animals have upon the regional landscapeWe are committed to working with state agencies ranchers and the sporting community in the region to limit conflicts and ensure that future generations will have the opportunity to hear the magic of a wolf

they cant decide what is legalSalazar noted that the delisting in the Rocky Mountains makes moot a request by Montana officials to allow them to remove 18 of about 30 wolves east of the Idaho border in the Bitterroot Valley where elk populations have dropped significantly in part due to wolf predationIt also will allow Montana and Idaho to institute a wolf hunting season this fall Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks is proposing to allow up to 220 of the known 566 wolves in the state to be shot by hunters and will discuss that at the FWP Commission meeting in Helena on May 12 Idaho state biologists are expected to present options in July with the Idaho Fish and Game Commission possibly adopting a harvest strategy at its meeting in AugustFWP Director Joe Maurier said he doesnt anticipate any early hunts to remove some of the wolves in the Bitterroot especially since many are parenting new pupsThere was a spring wolf hunt bill and the governor did veto that so we are waiting to make sure that it sticks and isnt overridden Maurier said The problem we have is by the time that unfolds and if we put a spring hunt before the commission it would probably be too late for that hunt Besides its only a few months away from the fall hunt So in the meantime well continue our normal depredation practiceAs part of Montanas wolf management plan which was approved by the US Fish and Wildlife Service wolves can be shot if theyre killing or threatening dogs or livestock or if authorized by FWP to resolve wolf/livestock conflictsAt least 566 wolves inhabited Montana at the end of 2010 in about 108 packs and to avoid relisting Montana must manage them in a manner that guarantees a minimum of 150 wolves and 15 breeding pairs The USFWS will monitor wolf populations in the Northern Rockies for at least five more yearsAs with other delisted species we will be applying the Endangered Species Acts post-delisting monitoring requirements to ensure that wolf populations remain robust while under state wildlife management said Interior Deputy Secretary David HayesMore than 1650 gray wolves now inhabit the Northern Rockies after being trapped hunted and poisoned to near extirpation in the early 1900s They were listed as endangered species in 1978 across all of the lower 48 states and Mexico except in Minnesota where the gray wolf was classified as threatenedAt least 4100 wolves now roam throughout the Western Great Lakes regionGray wolves were naturally moving into the Northern Rockies from Canada when their numbers were bolstered by their capture and release into Yellowstone National Park in 1995They will remain under federal protection in Wyoming until that state comes up with a management plan that is approved by the USFWSThe Department of Interior also is going to take a look at language included in the Endangered Species Act that involves whether they can be removed from the list of protected species along state boundaries US District Court Judge Donald Molloy ruled in August 2010 that wording in the Act doesnt allow that; Hayes said theyll look at changing it to allow delisting if a species is considered recovered within a significant portion of its rangeDo you look biologically at the range regardless of geographic lines or take a state-by-state approach? Hayes asked rhetorically We will put out proposed guidance -- its not ready yet -- but our inclination is to use the biological approach rather than state bordersWolves do cover a lot of territory so if you identify the range and  delist them in that range then you dont get to those questions about if a wolf in state XYZ can be delisted or notHe said the public will have opportunities to comment on that guidance when its readySalazar said he is convinced that their delisting is warranted especially after talking to Ed Bangs of Helena who was in charge of the reintroduction and recovery effort for the USFWSTwo years ago I had an hour with Ed Bangs who knows more about wolves than anybody on this planet Salazar said He has no doubt that wolves are recovered yet because of the way the Act worked it was very difficult for us to implement that programOne other step Salazar is exploring is whether to revise the range of the gray wolf by removing all or parts of 29 eastern states due to newer information indicating that the gray wolf did not historically occur in those statesThe federal government also will consider what the appropriate entity is and listing status of wolves in the Pacific Northwest and Southwest as well as seek information on a newly recognized species the eastern wolf -- or Canis lycaon -- throughout its range in the United States and Canada The service is seeking public comment as part of this processThe proposed rule to remove wolves in the Western Great Lakes from the ESA as well as the final rule reinstating the 2009 final delisting rule for the Northern Rocky Mountain DPS as directed by the 2011 Full-Year Appropriations Act will be published in the Federal Register today,Montana Idaho Endangered Species List  De-listing Gray Wolves Wyoming Recovery Hunting,Executive,Ken Salazar Secretary of the Interior,This is a tremendous success story for the Endangered Species Act It was just 16 years ago that gray wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone and now populations in the Northern Rockies and Western Great Lakes are biologically recovered Salazar said during a conference call with reporters Its time to return their management to the states that are prepared to manage themSalazar said he is convinced that their delisting is warranted especially after talking to Ed Bangs of Helena who was in charge of the reintroduction and recovery effort for the USFWSTwo years ago I had an hour with Ed Bangs who knows more about wolves than anybody on this planet Salazar said He has no doubt that wolves are recovered yet because of the way the Act worked it was very difficult for us to implement that program

Wyoming fights to join Montana and Idaho in getting its gray wolves removed from the endangered species list a new report indicates that its cattle have fared better with the predatorThe US Department of Agriculture last week reported that the number of cattle killed in Wyoming by wolves was actually decreasing while kills in neighboring Montana and Idaho had risen sharplyWolf-killed cattle have angered ranchers in all three states In 2010 wolves killed 570 adult cows and 1990 calves in Idaho according to the USDA Cattle Death Loss report issued last week Wolves in Montana killed 440 adult cows and 852 calves Wyoming fared better with 74 adult cows killed and 511 calvesFive years earlier Montana and Idahos losses were in line with Wyomings but as wolf populations in those states grew so did the wolf toll on cattle Wyoming saw a slight declineFewer kills shouldnt matter said Jim Magagna of the Wyoming Stock Growers AssociationI dont think it weakens the argument for delisting To me its a recovered species and the Endangered Species Act says that recovered populations should be delisted Magagna said The strongest argument for delisting in Wyoming in my view is the impact on wildlifeOutfitters have complained that elk populations around Yellowstone National Park have been dramatically thinned by wolvesHowever wolf advocates say attention to livestock kills in all three states is misguided Weather infection and other causes were the biggest killers of cattle in all three states with wolves accounting for a very small percentage of the deaths Nationwide the carnivore predators of all species including dogs accounted for less than 1 percent of the cattle killsWolves are really way down the list as an insignificant factor killing livestock said Michael Robinson of the Center for Biological Diversity Robinson argues that not only are wolves a small source of cattle kills but theyre also a source for which ranchers are fully compensated Ranchers are paid for cattle killed by wolves even when cattle have been put out to pasture on public land where wolves are known to exist Payments for wolf-killed cattle dont begin to cover the losses ranchers face said Jay Bodner the Montana Stockgrowers Associations director of natural resources Cattle under stress of wolf attacks lose weight and become more vulnerable to stress-related illness Bodner said Also the costs of moving livestock to safer pastures arent cheap and arent reimbursedBodner said wolves have killed more cattle in Montana and Idaho because in those states there are more cattle occupying areas where wolves are locatedWolf populations in Montana and Idaho could decline this year as those states begin managing wolves no longer listed as endangered Montana and Idaho succeeded in getting wolves delisted last month after Sen Jon Tester D-Mont and Rep Mike Simpson R-Idaho inserted the wolf delisting language into the 2011 appropriations billIt was a bill Congress had to pass in order to avoid a government shutdown The inserted language didnt include Wyoming which now seeks its own congressional fixOnce hunted to extinction in the West wolves were reintroduced to the region in the 1990s An estimated 1200 wolves now live in Montana and Idaho Wyomings population is believed to be 343 according to the US Fish and Wildlife serviceBoth Montana and Idaho plan wolf hunts this year Montana would like hunters to kill 220 gray wolves Idaho could set its quota by August Meantime Idaho has already sanctioned two wolf kills to curb wildlife and pet deaths associated with wolves

Lummis, a member of the House Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, helped to defeat an amendment that sought to strip the Lummis measure from the 2012 Interior and Environment Appropriations bill (174 - 250). The full bill is currently under debate.

Excerpts from Lummis' remarks from the House floor follow:

""It is the intent of this legislation as currently written, to make sure that the people who have the science, the background, the knowledge, to make sure that the wolf-- which has admittedly been recovered, admittedly, by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, recovered-- to be managed in a way that ensures that ongoing recovered status, and ensures it at the very level where you're able to do it, where the boots are on the ground of the wildlife biologists, and the paws are on the ground of the wolf, that is already recovered, but that needs to be maintained pursuant to a wolf management plan.

""Let's trust our states; their wildlife biologists. Let's trust my Wyoming Game and Fish Department that has been recognized as one of the best wildlife management agencies in the country. I'm stunned that people in Washington really believe that they can do it better and make decisions for wolves they've never seen, in places they've never been, and don't trust wildlife biologists they've never met.

""It is much better if the people on the ground where the wildlife are on the ground, where the interaction is on the ground, where the conditions are understood, where the geography is known, where the life expectancy, where the birthrates, where the survivability of the species can be witnessed and determined.""

BACKGROUND:

The wolf language reads:

""Sec. 119. Hereafter, any final rule published by the Department of the Interior that provides that the gray wolf (Canis lupus) in the State of Wyoming or in any of the States within the range of the Western Great Lakes Distinct Population Segment of the gray wolf (as defined in the rule published on May 5, 2011 (76.

U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy reluctantly upheld a budget rider passed by Congress in April that stripped wolves of federal protections in Montana, Idaho and parts of Washington, Oregon and Utah. The provision was inserted by Republican Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho and democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana. The measure marked the first time since the passage of the Endangered Species Act in 1973 that Congress forcibly removed protections from a plant or animal. Molloy, who twice blocked attempts to lift federal protections for the predators before Congress' action, did not hide his distaste for the provision. ""The way in which Congress acted in trying to achieve a debatable policy change by attaching a rider to the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 is a tearing away, an undermining and a disrespect for the fundamental idea of the rule of law,"" Molloy wrote in his order. But, he added, past rulings by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals requires him to interpret the rider as not violating the separation of powers, the constitutional principle ensuring none of the three branches of government tramples on the independence of the other branches. Conservation groups had challenged the rider's constituionally, arguing that it violated the separation of powers because its only aim was to countermand Molloy's past rulings without making any changes to the Endangered Species Act. But the judge ruled against them, upholding the congressional rider because of what Molloy called ""magic words"" included in it. The budget rider directed the Interior secretary to remove wolf protections ""without regard to any other provision of statute or regulation that applies to issuance of such rule."" The use of that exact phrase amends the Endangered Species Act by implication, Department of Justic attorneys argued, even if the rider didn't reference the specific law. Molloy said the 9th circuit has upheld that interpretation in the past so he must abide by it, even though he clearly disagrees with the appellate court. ""In my view, the 9th circuits deference to Congress threatens the Separation of Powers; nonspecific magic words should sweep aside constitutional concerns."" Molloy wrote. It was not immediately clear whether the conservation groups planned to appeal Molloy's ruling. Kieran Suckling, the executive director for the lead plaintiff in the case, the Center for Biological Diversity, said an appeal to the 9th Circuit is likely. Molloy's order lays out a road map for a possible appeal, with th judge saying he believes Congress acted unconstitutionaly but case law forces him to rule otherwise, Suckling said. ""He did everthing but buy us a bus ticket to San Francisco,"" Suckling said, refering to the appellate courts location ""That gives us hope that this isn't dead yet."" Congress' actions turned over wolf management to the Northern Rocky Mountain states except for Wyoming. There are an estimated 1,651 in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon and Washington. Idaho and Montana are planning to hold wolf hunts this fall to reduce the populations of the predator in those states. Tester said in a statement that now that the court has made its ruling, it's time to move ahead. ""Returning Montana's wolves to Montana management was the right thing to do, and we did it in a responsible way with utmost respect to existing law and to our constitution,"" he said. Wolves in Wyoming were not included in the budget rider due to concerns among federal officials over a law allowing the predators to be shot on sight across most of the state. But earlier Wednesday, the state and the US Department of Interiot reached an agreement over how to end federal protections for wolves there.

Wolves are a case in point The Northern Rocky Mountain (NRM) wolf population has by all reasonable counts fully recovered vastly surpassing even the most optimistic recovery goals The population has grown so large it has spilled out of its original recovery area with wolf packs showing up in Oregon Washington and Utah Recognizing a recovered species when they saw one the Fish and Wildlife Service delisted the NRM wolf population in states with approved management plans in 2009 Yet in spite of it being clear that wolves would continue to flourish activists went to court to force them back onto the list in 2010Keeping a strongly recovered wolf population on the endangered species list is in no ones best interest except those who benefit from ongoing litigation. On the other hand providing a long-term solution to the management of these animals serves the interest of the states the federal agencies ranchers and hunters and those whose true goal is sustainable wildlife populations in the Rocky Mountain westI included language in the fiscal year 2011 budget bill instructing the Fish and Wildlife Service to reissue their delisting rule in an effort to bring the ESA back in line with what Congress originally intended. The recovery of the gray wolf should be considered a success under the ESA What the debate about wolf delisting has revealed is that some groups will persist in keeping species like wolves listed in spite of all the evidence that they are recovered  proving that their end goal is not to recover species but to usurp the public process by forcing land and water management decisions to be made in court not by CongressHunters and fishermen are strong advocates for protecting our public lands and preserving wildlife but they are not fooled by groups that claim to share their interests but instead make a living suing the government in an effort to keep fullyrecovered species listed. We desperately need to reform the Endangered Species Act so that it encourages key partners to participate in the work of preserving and recovering species and making reasonable science-based decisions regarding wildlife management. As hunting season gets underway in Idaho and the wolf hunt is finally reinstated Idahoans know that the state is more than prepared to manage our wolf population

145,US Fish and Wildlife Service Proposes Gray Wolf Delisting and Transfer of Gray Wolf Management to the State of Wyoming,Y,10/4/2011,During,Targeted News Service,https://uwyoidmoclcorg/login?url=https://wwwproquestcom/wire-feeds/u-s-fish-wildlife-service-proposes-gray-wolf/docview/896160995/se-2?accountid=14793,Wolf Delisting AND Wyoming,Following approval of a revised wolf management plan by the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission the US Fish and Wildlife Service today proposed to remove the gray wolf population in Wyoming from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife Due to recovery efforts and the provisions of the revised state plan the Wyoming wolf population is healthy and stable current and future threats to wolves have been addressed and a post-delisting monitoring and management framework has been developedTodays formal proposal follows an agreement with the state of Wyoming that serves as the blueprint for returning wolf management to state control -- announced in principle in July and with more detail in August If this proposal is finalized the gray wolf would be delisted in Wyoming under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and future management for this species except in National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges would be conducted by the appropriate State or tribal wildlife agenciesAfter years of hard work by the Fish and Wildlife Service and our partners to achieve the successful recovery of wolves in the northern Rockies Wyoming wolves are ready to stand on their own under the management of the professional wildlife biologists of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department said Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe We expect Wyomings wolf population will be maintained well above recovery levels under State management and we have worked with the State to develop a strong post-delisting monitoring and management plan to ensure that this remarkable conservation success endures for future generationsThe Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population is biologically recovered with more than 1650 wolves 244 packs and over 110 breeding pairs It has exceeded recovery goals for 11 consecutive years fully occupies nearly all suitable habitat and has high levels of genetic diversityIn August the Service and the State of Wyoming announced an agreement that served as the basis for a revision to the States management plan The points of agreement promote the management of a stable sustainable population of wolves and pave the way for the Service to return wolf management to Wyoming A fact sheet about the agreement and its provisions is available here(http://wwwdoigov/news/pressreleases/loadercfm?csModule=security/getfile&pageid=255235) The states revised wolf management plan was approved by the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission on September 14 2011 The revised wolf management plan is available here(http://gfstatewyus/downloads/pdf/wolfplan2011/2011-09-14_FinalApprovedWolfMgmtPlanpdf)Finalizing this proposal to delist will be dependent on changes to Wyoming statutes and regulations necessary to conform to and implement the wolf management plan If the statutory or regulatory changes deviate significantly from the approved state wolf management plan the Service may need to withdraw the delisting proposal or reopen the comment period to provide the public an opportunity to review and comment on that information Until a final decision on this proposal is published wolves in Wyoming will remain fully protected under the ESAUnder the state plan wolves will continue to be subject to federal management in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and within the National Elk Refuge Outside of the parks and refuge wolves in northwestern Wyoming will be managed as trophy game animals and human-caused mortality (including hunting) will be carefully regulated Collectively this area encompasses nearly all of Wyomings current wolf breeding pairs the vast majority of the suitable habitat and is large enough to maintain Wyomings share of a recovered wolf population in the northern Rocky MountainsIn addition the trophy game area will expand from October 15 to the end of February each year This expanded trophy game area will provide additional protections to wolves to assist natural movement among populations by limiting unregulated wolf killing during mid to late winter when dispersal activity is highIn 2009 the Service published a final rule to remove ESA protections for wolves across the Northern Rocky Mountain gray wolf Distinct Population Segment (DPS) except in Wyoming Wyoming was excluded from the action because the states management plan did not provide the necessary regulatory mechanisms to assure that gray wolf populations would be conserved if the protections of the ESA were removed This scientifically based rule was later invalidated by the courts following legal challenge but was reinstated by Congressional directionThe Service is seeking scientific information and comments from the public about the proposal including the post-delisting monitoring and management framework Written comments regarding the proposal may be submitted by one of the following methods:* Federal eRulemaking Portal: http://wwwregulationsgov Follow the

Chairman Governor Otter I have lot of admiration for you Ive known you before you were congressman not just a congressman -- and now as a -- as a governor I just have one question for you and that basically is this -- personally Id like to thank you for the work that youve done with regard to wolf delisting You know were -- were doing all we can to keep wolves out of our State of UtahAnd as we did that can you give us an idea of the relationship with the US Fish and Wildlife ServiceThe US -- state wildlife managers have -- have the ability to manage the -- the way they -- they need to manage with regard to wolves and other -- other -- other animals as well OTTER: The rules were introduced 1995 Idaho resisted that re -- introduction -- as did Wyoming as did Montana But we were assured that once we got 10 packs per state or roughly 120 to 150 wolves per state -- delisting would be the next step in that programIdaho right now has well over 1000 wolves -- in Idaho In 2002 that program was amended to say if you get 30 packs within the Rocky Mountain region we will then -- which would be 350 to 400 wolves -- we will then delist And it took us all these years all these effort of broken promises by the federal government who sought to introduce the Canadian gray wolf into the old Rocky Mountain Timberwolf regions of -- of the West We put together a program in 2009 where we decided that we split the state up into regions mostly they were elk regions because we saw the great impact that it had on our elkLet me give you just one example The low -- low region which is not too far from where Lewis and Clark took their great adventure from the East Coast to the West Coast -- we had at one time the -- the Rocky Mountain elk treasure thereWhenever somebody wanted to establish elk they would come to Idaho we would help them trap a few elk and they could start their elk herds in other states and in other countries by the wayAt one time our numbers there were 16000 elk After the introduction of the wolf I would tell you that day that we had less than 2000 elk in that region Because we have just absolutely been devastated And people will tell you look the wolves dont take down the elk Quite frankly they do Or theyll only take the sick or the old They did they do But the other thing they do is they stress the elk herds And the stressed mother elk will not impregnate Because theyre being chased theyre being dislocated from their -- their -- their previous habitat and as a result of that the devastation to our large jungle herds primarily a Rocky Mountain elk has just been devastatingAt one time in Idaho we had nearly 5000 outfitters and guides whose business was to make sure folks from other states that want to come to Idaho and enjoy a hunt and also take a trophy elk -- we have now less than 2000 outfitters and guides in the state of IdahoSo to our economy to our natural habitat to our great pride in our large aim herds it has been devastating We are as you know and thanks to Congress and the addition of an amendment on continuing resolution we now have an elk hunt -- oh pardon me -- a wolf hunt going on in Idaho -- Montanas just closeAnd weve been very responsible on that were going to maintain those limited numbers for a sustainable wolf count in the state of Idaho primarily because he want wolves -- no not necessarily but because we know that if we drop below a certain number in Idaho the federal government will come back in and take over the management of the wolves And weve already had an experience with their management wed rather have ours HATCH: Well thank you we had a similar experience in Utah as well Thank you,Idaho Wolf De-listing,Executive,Idaho Gov CL Butch Otter,OTTER: The rules were introduced

we had at one time the -- the Rocky Mountain elk treasure thereWhenever somebody wanted to establish elk they would come to Idaho we would help them trap a few elk and they could start their elk herds in other states and in other countries by the wayAt one time our numbers there were 16000 elk After the introduction of the wolf I would tell you that day that we had less than 2000 elk in that region Because we have just absolutely been devastated And people will tell you look the wolves dont take down the elk Quite frankly they do Or theyll only take the sick or the old They did they doBut the other thing they do is they stress the elk herds And the stressed mother elk will not impregnate Because theyre being chased theyre being dislocated from their -- their -- their previous habitat and as a result of that the devastation to our large jungle herds primarily a Rocky Mountain elk has just been devastatingAt one time in Idaho we had nearly 5000 outfitters and guides whose business was to make sure folks from other states that want to come to Idaho and enjoy a hunt and also take a trophy elk -- we have now less than 2000 outfitters and guides in the state of IdahoSo to our economy to our natural habitat to our great pride in our large aim herds it has been devastating We are as you know and thanks to Congress and the addition of an amendment on continuing resolution we now have an elk hunt -- oh pardon me -- a wolf hunt going on in Idaho -- Montanas just closeAnd weve been very responsible on that were going to maintain those limited numbers for a sustainable wolf count in the state of Idaho primarily because he want wolves -- no not necessarily but because we know that if we drop below a certain number in Idaho the federal government will come back in and take over the management of the wolves And weve already had an experience with their management wed rather have ours

208,WOLVES TO THE SLAUGHTER,Y,4/1/2012,After,The American Prospect,https://wwwproquestcom/docview/1243385493/abstract/EC9E459C5D7E47ECPQ/1?accountid=14793&sourcetype=Magazines,Wolf Delisting AND Rocky Mountain,The reintroduction of the gray wolf to the Northern Rockies was an ecological success story-until big money old superstitions and politics got in the way In April 2001 a US government wildlife trapper named Carter Niemeyer choppered into the mountains of central Idaho to slaughter a pack of wolves whose alpha female was famed for her whiteness He hung from the open door of the craft with a semiautomatic shotgun the helicopter racing over the treetops Then in a clearing Niemeyer caught a glimpse of her platinum fur Among wolf lovers in Idaho she was called Alabaster and she was considered a marvel- most wolves are brown or black or gray People all over the world had praised Alabaster had written about her had longed to see her in the flesh Livestock ranchers in central Idaho whose sheep and cows graze in wolf country felt otherwise They claimed Alabaster and her pack- known as the Whitehawks- threatened the survival of their herds which in turn threatened the rural economy of the high country She had to be exterminatedWhen Alabaster appeared in Niemeyers sights a hundred feet below the helicopter her ears recoiled from the noise and the rotor wash but she was not afraid She labored slowly along a ridge looking Niemeyer says like something out of a fairy taleThen he shot her At the time wolves were considered a rare species in Idaho and across the Northern Rockies and they were protected under the Endangered Species Act But they could be targeted for lethal control if they made trouble- if they threatened a human being which almost never happened or more commonly if they were implicated in attacking cattle and sheep The Whitehawks allegedly had been enjoying a good number of cows and sheep that spring and were said to have killed at least one ranchers guard dogAs a trapper for the US Department of Agriculture and later as a wolf expert for the US Fish and Wildlife Service Niemeyer was trained to control predators mostly coyotes and foxes In 26 years working for the government he had killed thousands of coyotes But wolves are a different kind of kill As predators they are exquisite Niemeyer had taken a liking to wolves He respected themThere were four other members of the pack scattered in the woods The helicopter circled flushing them out and Niemeyer shot them as they ran When he necropsied Alabaster at the kill site- gutting her stripping her pelt- he found she was pregnant with nine pups that were two weeks from birth almost fully formed He buried each pupCards lupus the largest of the planets wild dogs once numbered in the hundreds of thousands in the US The creatures are powerful- the largest males six and half feet from tooth to tail weigh 140 pounds- and they are age and cunning They run in packs of seven to ten animals that consist of a father and mother- the alphas- along with pups and subordinate males and females unrelated to the family but welcomed in their midst The wolf is an apex predator at the top of its food chain keeping prey from overpopulating which maintains a balanced ecosystemWith European settlement and the decimation of its native prey- buffalo elk mule deer- the wolf was bound for destruction It was now killing for its meals the domesticated sheep and cattle that settlers had ranged across the grasslands and the mountains Hated for its depredations the wolf was hunted mercilessly- shot trapped poisoned with strychnine fed glass shards stuffed in bait its pups asphyxiated by fires set in their dens By 1935 the gray wolf had disappeared almost entirely from the USDecades later during the high tide of 1970s environmentalism conservationists began to agitate for a governmentsponsored recovery The evidence suggested that the loss of the wolves had destabilized the ecology of the Northern Rockies Following the passage of the Endangered Species Act in 1973 the US Fish and Wildlife Service undertook the recovery of the wolf in the region It wasnt until 1991 however that Congress mandated an impact study of wolf reintroduction By 1994 funding had been approved for Fish and Wildlife biologists to remove 66 gray wolves from Canada where the animals still numbered in the tens of thousands and truck them south for release in central Idaho and Yellowstone National ParkNiemeyer now retired in Boise was among the trappers who traveled to Canada in 1995 to capture and radio-collar the reintroduced wolves The reintroduction he told me had been one of the epic wildlife-recovery stories in US history; in little more than 15 years the number of wolves in the Northern Rockies had gone from 66 to roughly 1600 Yet concerns about the threat posed by the wolves to cow sheep and elk populations had led to a stark reversal After spending upward of $40 million studying the animals- then capturing collaring tracking and protecting them- the federal government last year scheduled wolves to be killed in huge numbers across the Northern Rockies In April 2011 following a series of lawsuits and an unprecedented intervention by Congress cards lupus was removed from the endangered species listToday as a result of the delisting anyone can shoot a wolf- you dont have to be a government trapper Wolves can in some circumstances be shot on sight Niemeyer who is six foot six inches and giant-shouldered shot 14 wolves in the course of his government career; the Whitehawks were his last He maintains a taxidermy studio in his garage and says hes not into the warm and fuzzy thing when it comes to wild animals Im not grossed out by wolves being hunted trapped killed he says Id skin one today if you brought it to me What Im caught up in is honesty What you have with wolf delisting is half-truths untruths hysteria and just downright crazinessThe ranching industry in the American West has been the historic enemy of wolves so it was fitting that ranchers in Montana and Idaho called for hunting them almost from the moment of their rintroduction The American Farm Bureau Federation a nonprofit advocate for farming and ranching interests had even sued preemptively in 1994 to stop the reintroduction but a federal court rejected the suit In 2008 however Western livestock interests found a sympathetic ear in the Bush administrations Department of the Interior which issued what would become the first of multiple orders to remove the wolf from protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)Following a lawsuit filed by 12 conservation groups that challenged the decision the US District Court in Montana found that the department had acted arbitrarily in delisting the wolf and reinstated the acts protections Judge Donald Molloy pointed to a glaring discrepancy: Biologists had determined that only with the genetic commingling of the three distinct population segments of wolves- in central Idaho Yellowstone National Park and northwestern Montanawould the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf have a chance at long-term survival A 2009 study in BioScience magazine concluded that absent this genetic exchange the population would be genetically depleted small and ineffective in terms of ecosystem function The Interior Departments own environmental impact study conducted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service had come to the same conclusion Yet the department had removed the Endangered Species Act protections without any evidence of genetic exchange wrote Judge Molloy who found a possibility of irreparable harm if the delisting went unchallengedThe matter remained at an impasse until President Barack Obamas newly appointed interior secretary Ken Salazar resurrected the Bush-era delisting plan in April 2009 The decision infuriated pro-wolf conservationists though it was not unexpected Salazar a Colorado Democrat comes from a family of five generations of ranchers A new lawsuit was filed by a coalition that included 14 environmental groups among them the Natural Resources Defense Council the Sierra Club the Humane Society and smaller outfits like the Center for Biological Diversity While the suit was pending Idaho and Montana opened a hunting season that resulted in the culling of more than 500 wolves- some 32 percent of the entire Northern Rockies population A year later in August 2010 Judge Molloy again ruled in the conservationists favor He determined that the delisting violated the letter and the spirit of the Endangered Species Act; he found no evidence of genetic exchange among wolf sub-populations He also ruled that Fish and Wildlife had failed to properly oversee wolf management plans in Idaho and Montana The judge ordered that years wolf hunts to be canceledThe ongoing litigation drew the ire of Republican politicians throughout the West Denny Rehberg Montanas lone congressman presented two bills during 2011 for a legislative delisting of the wolf including one to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to provide that Act shall not apply to the gray wolf The bills went nowhere but Rehberg who was gearing up to challenge Democrat Jon Tester for his US Senate seat in 2012 had sparked a kind of arms race of antiwolf rhetoric The Republican governor of Idaho Butch Otter announced that he was ordering his state wildlife managers to relinquish their duty to arrest poachers thereby freeing up Idaho hunters to continue shooting wolves Otter also signed an emergency law that authorized him to declare a statewide wolf disaster Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah unsuccessfully attempted to amend the Endangered Species Act so that it no longer applied to any gray wolf Montana Senator Max Baucus a Democrat weighed in with the Delisting Gray Wolves to Restore State Management Act of 2011 which died in committee Tester floated his own wolf-delisting bill; it also went nowhereDemocrats have never in the entire history of the ESA let bills like this go through says Kieran Suckling executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity In the past no matter how aggressive the Republicans have been about undermining the ESA we have been able to rely on Democrats to put up an aggressive fight threaten to veto legislation and wage a public campaign to defend the ESAThen almost overnight the Democratic position changed According to multiple sources Salazar and Tester put together a deal to let delisting go forward in Congress Tester convinced the White House that his re-election campaign would be in jeopardy without the delisting Suckling says We heard this in very high-level conversations with Testers people and with Interior Salazar according to sources argued that he couldnt get the wolf delisted administratively due to the lawsuits so Congress needed to take action (Salazar declined interview requests for this story)Tester joined forces with Republican Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson to settle the issue In lieu of presenting legislation to attack the Endangered Species Act and wolf protections directly they wrote a legislative rider into the 2011 federal budget bill It would enact Salazars April 2009 delisting rule- the one that Judge Molloy had determined to be illegal under the ESA- and also bar any judicial review of the delisting putting an end to the lawsuits In testimony before the House Appropriations Committee Salazar endorsed the rider saying We support the language crafted and introduced by Senator Tester The White House signaled its acquiescence by remaining silent On April 9 amid tense negotiations over the threat of a government shutdown the rider- the only one in the budget bill- passed with all but three Democrats in the Senate voting in favor On April 15 the president signed itTester declined several requests for interviews However a spokesperson said Montanas wolves are a recovered species and must be responsibly managed like all other recovered species Senator Tester worked hard to reach a bipartisan science-based solution that brings wolves back under state management and works for MontanaThis wasnt even about the wolf It was about keeping Tester in office says Denise Boggs director of the Conservation Congress a nonprofit grassroots environmental group based in Montana Obama and Salazar calculated that they could sacrifice the wolf- and the ESA- in order to keep Testers seat in CongressNever before had a species been delisted as a result of congressional fiat The rider was barely discussed much less debated Only one legislator Maryland Senator Ben Cardin raised an objection An open letter to the Senate signed by more than 1200 concerned biologists urging legislators to vote against the rider warned that the fate of every species on the endangered species list (or any candidate for that list) would then be subject to political interference Suckling says that the legislative delisting of the gray wolf never would have happened if Obama had said No Im not gonna sign it The real surprise here is the remarkable and unprecedented betrayal of the Endangered Species Act by a Democratic presidentSenator Tester and Congressman Simpson had been lobbied by what at first glance appeared to be a wide-ranging anti-wolf coalition It included various sportsmens groups; the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation which views the proliferation of wolves as a threat to elk hunting; and the National Rifle Association which sees in the continued protection of the wolf a backhanded slap at gun culture But ranching and livestock associations dominated the anti-wolf lobby Out of 47 groups listed by the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation as calling for Congress [to] stop the manipulating use of the Endangered Species Act to tie up wolf delisting in the courts 37 represented branches of the livestock industry Not least among them was the powerful National Cattlemens Beef Association which represents the $44 billion cattle-production industry and its affiliated lobby group the Public Lands Council whose stated mission is preserving the natural resources and unique heritage of the West The association named the delisting of wolves as its No 2 priority for 2011; its first priority was to deflect lawsuits over grazing rights on public lands Tester has been the Senates top recipient of livestock lobby money during the 2012 election cycle The Cattlemens Beef Association ranks fourth among contributors to Simpson over the past yearThe livestock industry wields astonishing power over federal land-use policy in the West and the industrys concern over the fate of the wolf was a proxy fight over who would control the land According to the Western Watersheds Project an Idaho-based nonprofit that monitors the livestock industry an estimated $2 billion to $3 billion is spent each year in state federal and county subsidies to support the survival of ranching on more than 250 million acres of land managed by the US Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management For the benefit of public-lands ranchers the federal government clears forest plants grass replaces native vegetation with genetically modified exotic flora builds roads and cattle guards and fences dredges springs and seeps diverts streams blows up beaver dams improves habitat by bulldozing and crop-dusting and monitors the health of livestock Department of Interior economist Robert Nelson analyzing government aid to public-lands ranchers in the 1990s referred to it as a pocket of socialismIts almost a matter of religiosity that the real costs of ranching are paid for by the public says Brian Ertz media director with the Western Watersheds Project Democratic and Republican congresspersons alike make their way up through political environments of extreme livestockculture-dominated political organizations The statehouses are dominated by livestock interests and thats where the federal representatives cut their teeth Tester Ertz points out was a cattleman himselfThe livestock industrys power extends far enough that it has secured its own federally funded wolf-killing unit a branch of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) called Wildlife Services Largely unknown to the public Wildlife Services began in 1931 as the Branch of Predator and Rodent Control It changed its name to Animal Damage Control in 1974 and took its current name in the 1990s Its chief mandate in the Rockies is the killing of predators- cougars coyotes wolves- through trapping snaring hunting aerial gunning and dispersing poisons across public lands Last year the agency spent more than $11 million on wolf control in five mountain states Ranchers assert that wolves today are plundering livestock in record numbers and that the work of Wildlife Services is indispensableCarter Niemeyer worked for Wildlife Services for 26 years By the end of his tenure in 2000 when he joined the Fish and Wildlife Service to oversee wolf recovery in Idaho- and occasionally shoot problem wolves such as the Whitehawks- he had concluded that agents considered themselves the hired guns of the livestock industry The agents live among the ranchers; their children attend the same schools Its not surprising that they often adopt the same point of view and Niemeyer says regularly inflate the number of wolf depredationsMost of the trappers I knew did their investigations with the tips of their boots Niemeyer says Yep theyd say looks like a wolf did it It quickly became the fashion to blame wolves for all things dead But Niemeyer says that when he conducted his own investigations skinning the dead livestock knifing through the summer-heated bloat and the maggots and the stench looking for how death came to pass too often he found that the ranchers claim that a wolf did it was either a lie or a delusion I was amazed he writes in his memoir Wolfer that conservative God-fearing rural folks could conjure up such absurd ideas about how a farm animal became dead The ranchers whose claims he refused to certify fumed and cursed and threw their Stetsons against the wall Everywhere the wolf appeared he was told livestock were not only under attack but generally declining in quality because the wolves made the animals anxious and run off weight Wolves are supposedly costing ranchers hundreds of thousands of dollars annually running the weight off sheep and cattle Niemeyer says I dont know where anybody has proved this but anecdotally it sure sounds convincing dont it? Bullshit Document itThe ranchers assertions are reflected in the USDAs National Agricultural Statistics Service which relies for its data on what amounts to unverified reports from ranchers and the investigations of Wildlife Services agents In Idaho during 2010-2011 the Statistics Service reported 2561 cattle lost to wolf attack When Fish and Wildlife investigated it found that only 75 of the attacks could be verified According to the Statistics Service sheep killed by wolves in 2010-2011 came to 900 but Fish and Wildlife investigators could only verify 148 Even using its own apparently inflated statistics the USDA found that in 2010 less than a quarter of a percent of US cattle or 023 percent were lost to predators (the predator list included not just wolves but also coyotes cougars bobcats lynx bears and others) By contrast in 2009 Wildlife Services was responsible for killing roughly 12 percent of the total population of wolves in the Northern RockiesIdahos current management plan calls for the states estimated 750 wolves- about half the Northern Rockies population of 1600- to be reduced to 150 over the course of a six-month hunting season I asked the Fish and Wildlife Services wolf-recovery coordinator Edward Bangs about the rationale for this number The issue has nothing to do with science Bangs said The issue of how many wolves is enough is totally about what people want and how many wolves people will tolerateLast October a hunter named Victor Turchan hiked into a forest of pines in the Bitterroot Mountains of Idaho to kill a wolf for the season Turchan who is long-haired and lean and craggy-faced moved over the land as a trained hunter- slowly listening looking He was a bowman by preference but this day he carried a high-powered rifleTurchan climbed on steep hills where he knew elk liked to gather; where there were elk there would be wolves on the prowl He waited He queried the forest with his electronic caller which had functions like calf in distress and crow party a mimicking of when crows feast on carrion Any sound that suggested death weakness or vulnerability he said would bring out the wolvesThe wolf packs in recent years had increasingly harassed the elk in the Bitterroots thinning the herds and the business Turchan runs during the summer and fall- a pizza restaurant and RV park near the town of North Fork- depends on the elk for survival If the wolves kill too many elk the elk hunters will not find easy prey in the mountains hurting businesses like TurchansTurchan sighted no wolves that day and got no kill But he had been doing his best to inspire others to take up the cause Id initially stopped at his restaurant because the sign out front caught my attention: Tag a Wolf it said Get a Free Pizza It used to be Get a free pitcher of beer too but I couldnt afford it Turchan said as I took a picture of the sign When I mentioned that I was writing about wolves he invited me into the restaurant and insisted on opening the kitchen early so I could eat A middle-aged man and a sharp-dressed woman walked in and we got to talking about how wolves killed their sons three dogs- tore one of the dogs pretty much in half You sure came to the right place for wolf haters the woman told me Her husband chimed in: Wolves are very good at what they do which is stalking and killing Turchans bartender a jovial big-chested fellow named Mike wore a T-shirt that said Got wolves? Shoot em On the wall was a sign that said Smoke a pack a day with a bulls-eye over a wolf silhouette Above his head over the bar was a stuffed wolf mounted in mid-snarl and next to the bulls-eye silhouette were trophy photographs of dead wolves held high by men in camouflage The bodies of the animals hung limp and heavy in the arms of the hunters Their heads looked almost twice as big as a mansTurchan directed me to an essay called Why They Love Predators written by a retired Fish and Wildlife Service agent named Jim Beers Beers had repudiated his old employer- he had worked for Fish and Wildlife for 34 years as a wetlands biologist and then as a special agent enforcing the Endangered Species Act- and had become a hero in the anti-wolf community in Idaho where groups like the Idaho Anti-Wolf Coalition have taken to denouncing wolves as governmentsponsored terroristsWhen I called him at his home in Minnesota Beers told me that the wolf was not in fact endangered Theyre all over Asia Theyre ubiquitous in Alaska and Canada The idea that theyre endangered is bullshit The reintroduced wolf in the U S said Beers was an insidious thing a genie out of the bag I asked him if wolves werent being demonized in the manner that historically has been their lot: the wolf cast as the devils minion as a friend to witches as symbol of mans bestial nature as the enemy of civilization itself Beers raised his voice Why do you think people came to those conclusions? Was it all fable? Why did the Irish breed wolfhounds specifically to kill wolves? Why did their dogs wear spiked collars? You think all these people over all these centuries saying the same thing about wolves were all dumb superstitious ignoramuses?Wolf reintroduction according to the wolf haters was undemocratic a top-down measure forced on the mountain states against the public interest Yet according to Ed Bangs the Fish and Wildlife Services wolf-recovery coordinator the congressionally mandated environmental impact statement on wolf reintroduction drew more public attention and response than any proposed action in the history of the serviceThe anti-wolf people say the reintroduced wolves from Canada are bigger more bloodthirsty more dangerous and that the wolves in the US prior to extirpation in the 1930s were meek and easily dispatched They say the new wolves are foreigners an invasive species These new wolves kill for sport as Victor Turchan had explained to me Sport-killing? Its just endless bullshit Carter Niemeyer says These are people talking through their hats And if the wolves that were here were so gentle and sweet less wild and smaller why did we kill them all by the 1930s?It is said that these wilder wolves have put dozens of hunting guides and outfitters and restaurateurs like Turchan out of business by decimating elk The Montana Department of Fish Wildlife and Parks reports that elk numbers in some areas have declined due in part to wolf predation Yet in other areas where wolves and elk interact elk numbers are stable or increasing According to the Endangered Species Coalition total elk population in the Northern Rockies has in fact risen since wolves were restored- from 312000 to 371000 a 19 percent increase since 1994What the elk-hunting industry wants says Niemeyer who shoots an elk every year for the meat is hunting that requires no effort and little skill a kind of vanity hunting When wolves were reintroduced elk adapted The herds once loose and relaxed became tightly packed and watchful They fled from open range and spent more time in the cover of the woods Today theyre more difficult to hunt They are smarter- the species in other words has improvedIn Yellowstone National Park biologist William Ripple a professor at the College of Forestry at Oregon State University has found that when there were no wolves elk ran amok They overgrazed the banks of streams and they ate away the sprouts of aspen trees resulting in stunted aspen groves After roughly 15 years of wolves on the move in Yellowstone the aspens are taller and healthier and the willows on the stream banks recovered When the willows recovered they shaded the water which cooled and in the cooling water the trout returned The trout were food for the beaver which dammed the waters and built ponds Songbirds returned to the ponds and so did frogsYellowstone increasingly looks like a different place for the first time in 70 years Ripple says The signs are very encouraging Ripple compares this remarkable restoration in Yellowstone with four other national parks where no wolves were present In these parks the loss of large predators allowed large herbivores- cattle sheep elk- to heavily impact riparian plant communities thus leading to a loss of biodiversity Only in Yellowstone with its healthy wolf population does Ripple find ecosystem restoration A study Ripple co-authored last year in Science magazine concluded that the decline of large predators in all regions of the world is causing substantial changes to Earths terrestrial freshwater and marine ecosystems The loss of apex consumers from ecosystems says the report may be humankinds most pervasive influence on natureWe now have overwhelming evidence that large predators are hugely important in the function of nature from deep oceans to high mountains from the tropics to the Arctic Ripple told me Large predators typically keep their prey populations in check and this process provides an important ecosystem service When we kill off predators prey populations can erupt causing declines in the function of ecosystems and potentially a decrease in biodiversityRanching by contrast is considered one of the top causes of desertification deforestation and species extinction in the American West An estimated 80 percent of the streams and riparian ecosystems in the West have been damaged by livestock grazing The UN Food and Agriculture Organization reports that livestock production in the US is responsible for 55 percent of all erosion and one-third of the loads of nitrogen and phosphorus in freshwater systems The Journal of Arid Environments published a study in 1998 that found that a hundred years of livestock grazing on public lands near the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico was more damaging for the long-term development and recovery of flora than multiple nuclear-bomb blasts In its 2006 study of the worldwide environmental damage from livestock production the Food and Agriculture Organization concluded that the livestock sector may well be the leading player in the reduction of biodiversityLast October I went out into the mountains near Ketchum Idaho to look for a black female wolf known as B-412 Radio -collared by Fish and Wildlife in 2008 she had been targeted for killing by Wildlife Services My guide was a wolf activist named Natalie Ertz (Brian Ertzs sister) who was able to track B-412 on a radio she had rigged in her truck Ertz told me that B-412 was easily recognized because shes a bit of a cripple Years ago she had gotten her foot caught in a coyote trap lost two toes and developed a limp She had also lost six of her pups in the Soldier Mountains 40 miles west of Ketchum where she had been an alpha in the Soldier Mountain pack The pups had perhaps died of disease or perhaps a poacher had killed them After the loss of her pups she abandoned the Soldier Mountains and headed east toward Ketchum into the hills near the Little Wood River near Bell Mountain where she met a black male a yearling He was shot by a Wildlife Services trapper B-412 was also targeted with the same control order but she was able to escape on Bell Mountain where she ended up with a gray male They had pups together and soon had formed the Bell Mountain pack which Ertz had watched in the summertime among the cottonwoods and aspens on the Little Wood River The pack liked the cool the shade the green light of the trees They would get in the water and roll around and relaxErtz and I drove for two hours listening for the sound of B-412s signal There was no sign of herI still wanted to see a wolf in the wild so a few days later I telephoned a 63-year-old woman named Lynne Stone head of a nonprofit wolf-advocacy group in Ketchum the BoulderWhite Clouds Council Stone told me to meet her by the side of the road in the Big Wood River Valley just before dusk 20 miles north of Ketchum and we would go howlingWe got in her truck and clanged on a rutted dirt path along a ridge on the shanks of the Boulder Mountains Stone had been tracking the packs in the hills for more than a decade She had practically lived with them She had watched them pair up and become alphas and have pups had watched them play and hunt had heard them howl and had answered She had given them names like Mary Magdalene and Angel and Papa Wolf who was old and gray and grumpy Several of the alpha males and females in the area packs had been killed in recent months and the survivors she said had gone into a kind of mourningI grew up as a

takes a lot to shock and sicken seasoned wildlife advocates but the deliberate torture and shooting of a trapped wolf in northern Idaho by an employee of the US Forest Service has The incident in mid-March has triggered calls for both federal and state investigations leading to dismissal of the employee involvedThe nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity Tuesday sent letters to both the Forest Service and the Idaho Attorney General requesting investigations into the actions of Forest Service employee Josh Bransford who posted online photos of a wolf he had trapped that was then non-fatally shot by people who saw the animal from a nearby roadA year ago that wolf was protected as a member of an endangered species but last month he was trapped tortured and killed thanks to an underhanded congressional rider thats also responsible for the deaths of hundreds of other wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains said the Centers Michael RobinsonA lack of respect for the balance of nature is leading to a war on wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains Robinson saidStripping wolves of federal protection last spring transferred management of the animals to five states including Idaho Since the de-listing last May Idaho has cut its wolf population by about 40 percent from roughly 1000 to 570 Idaho Fish and Game biologists estimated last monthThe delisting was required by a rider on a budget resolution passed by Congress in April 2011 that funded the federal government for the remainder of the 2011 fiscal yearThe rider was attached to the federal budget bill by Senator Jon Tester a Montana Democrat and Representative Mike Simpson an Idaho Republican and marked the first time an animal or plant has been removed from the endangered species list by CongressPhoto posted by Pinching of the trapped wolf in Idaho after it was shot by passing motoristsThe treatment of this trapped wolf became public knowledge on March 19 when Bransford using the name Pinching posted his story and pictures on the hunters and trappers website wwwTrappermancomA posted photo shows the Forest Service employee smiling in front of the still-living wolfI got a call on Sunday morning from a FS [Forest Service] cop that I know You got one up here as there was a crowd forming Several guys had stopped and taken a shot at him already wrote Pinching The big black male wolf stood in the trap some 300-350 yards from the road wounded -- the shots left him surrounded by blood-stained snowThe posting appears to have been removed from the Trappermancom siteIdaho state law makes it a crime for a person who causes or procures any animal to be cruelly treated or who having the charge or custody of any animal either as owner or otherwise subjects any animal to cruelty The law also requires that destruction of animals for population control the stated reason for wolf trapping be carried out humanelyMaking it possible for potshots to be taken at a captive animal -- and photographing the results -- before ending the wolfs suffering appears to violate this law as well as common decency said RobinsonThese photos make plain that the trapping and hunting of wolves being allowed by the state of Idaho are less wildlife-management techniques than scapegoating of wolves Robinson said This egregious torture of a wolf needs to be investigated by Idahos attorney general and the Forest Service and Josh Bransford should be fined and dismissed from his positionIn his letter to Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell the Centers Executive Director Kieran Suckling wrote On behalf of our over 350000 members and online supporters we request an investigation into whether the trapping and treatment of the wolf depicted in the photograph below by Nez Perce National Forest employee Josh Bransford constitutes employee misconduct and further that you consider terminating Mr Bransfords employment It is our contention that the trapping of the wolf which occurred on the weekend of March

May 5 2011 Congress used a budget rider to remove the Northern Rockies wolf from the list of endangered species For the past year Idaho and Montana have been in charge of managing wolves in their states Idaho in particular has pursued very aggressive strategies including allowing very liberal hunting and trapping seasons during which more than 375 wolves have been killed so far Dozens more wolves have been killed in Idaho as a result of targeted removals in response to livestock losses and to artificially boost elk herds in select areasThe following is a statement from Jamie Rappaport Clark president of Defenders of Wildlife:For years Idahos leaders repeatedly said that they would manage wolves responsibly Idaho wildlife biologists even wrote a plan to maintain 518-732 wolves But Idaho Governor Otter rescinded the biologists plan and state officials indicate they have no plans to manage for more than 150 wolves It seems when finally given the chance to manage their own wolves responsibly Idaho has shown itself quite unwilling to do soIn the past year state officials have pursued some of the exact same short-sighted predator control strategies from the 1800s that put wolves on the endangered species list in the first place Theyre treating wolves like vermin instead of managing them like valuable native wildlife Thats not how Idaho manages other species like black bears

state officials At last months Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting wolf supporters outnumbered opponents more than three to one yet not one of our concerns about more than doubling the number of wolves that hunters and trappers can kill in the upcoming season were addressed The state pledged to manage wolves like they do other wildlife but mountain lions and black bears are not managed this

environmental groups say theyre alarmed that the US Fish and Wildlife Service is considering a plan to end federal protections for gray wolves in vast areas where the animals no longer exist The groups say ending federal protections would keep wolves from expanding their range back into states that could support them including Colorado and CaliforniaAs a matter of principle I just think its wrong said Jay Tutchton a Colorado lawyer with the group WildEarth GuardiansTutchtons group has sued over recent action to end federal protections for wolves in Wyoming Wolves in most of the Cowboy State are classified as unprotected predators and scores have been killed since federal protections ended last fallThe Endangered Species Act was designed to protect species including in places where they no longer reside Tutchton said You were supposed to try to recover them not throw in the towelThe Fish and Wildlife Service could announce as soon as this spring whether it will propose a blanket delisting of wolves in most of the lower 48 states Wolves in the Northern Rockies and around the Great Lakes where reintroduced populations are well-established are already off the Endangered Species ListChris Tollefson spokesman for the US Fish and Wildlife Service in Washington DC said Tuesday that the agency hasnt made any decision yet whether it will propose the blanket delisting An agency report last year proposed dropping wolves from the endangered list in most areas where theyre known not to liveEven if the Fish and Wildlife Service ends federal protections Tollefson said states would be free to cultivate their own wolf populations Its fair to say that there wouldnt be a prohibition it would simply be left to the states to determine how to manage wolves in their boundaries he saidTollefson said his agency regards the wolf recovery efforts in the Great Lakes states and Northern Rockies as enormous successesOur view and that of the biological community is that those populations are thriving and no longer require the protections of the Endangered Species Act Tollefson said Obviously well be discussing other areas as we move forward on thatBoth sides lobbyingThe prospect of the national delisting has prompted members of Congress on both sides of the issue to lobby the Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan AsheSeventy-two members of Congress most of the Republicans signed the most recent letter to Ashe on Friday urging him to go through with the delisting Another group of scores of congressmen wrote to Ashe earlier this month urging him to reject the delisting ideaUnmanaged wolves are devastating to livestock and indigenous wildlife the members of Congress led by Rep Cynthia Lummis R-Wyo and Sen Orrin Hatch R-Utah and others wrote to Ashe last week Currently state wildlife officials have their hands tied any time wolves are involvedLummis said Tuesday that the letter was intended to celebrate the successful recovery of wolvesI know some will wring their hands over a delisting but for the life of me I dont understand why they dont throw a party instead Lummis stated In most suitable habitat and in states that strongly objected to their presence initially the wolf is here to stay For some that is a bitter pill to swallow for others its not enough but the bottom line is there are wolves where there once were none and everyone but the most litigious among us seem ready to move onBob Brister wildlife campaign coordinator for the Utah Environmental Congress in Salt Lake City has been campaigning to restore wolves to Utah where he said they were extirpated in the 1930sBrister said the effect of delisting wolves in Utah and elsewhere where they currently dont exist would be to preclude their ultimate recovery back into their historic range He noted that wolves are hunted heavily in the Wyoming Utah and Montana and that states cant be counted on to provide the protections new populations would need to surviveIts especially dire here in Utah because we depend on wolves migrating from Wyoming and Idaho to restore wolves here in Utah Brister said And when theyre being hunted so intensely in Wyoming and Idaho it greatly decreases the possibility of wolves migrating into UtahErik Molvar executive director of the Bioldiversity Conservation Alliance in Laramie Wyo also noted that Wyoming Idaho and Montana allow substantial wolf hunting He said delisting wolves across the rest of the Lower 48 would seem to be a very unwise move given the tenuous status of wolf populations in this areaMolvar whose group also is challenging the recent delisting of wolves in Wyoming said its clear there are other areas of the West that could support wolf populationsIt certainly is true that there are places in Colorado particularly Rocky Mountain National Park where elk are so overpopulated that theyre becoming a nuisance that wolves are one of the few options to restore the natural balance Molvar saidTutchton said his group and others are likely to fight the sweeping delisting effortIm very sure that if wolves were delisted in Colorado we would want to sue If wolves get delisted in Oklahoma I dont know That might be a different question Tutchton said There are some places where wolves would be quite viable,Endangered Species List  De-listing Endangered Species Act Wolf Wyoming NGO Recovery Hunting,Executive,Chris Tollefson US Fish and Wildlife Service ,Chris Tollefson spokesman for the US Fish and Wildlife Service in Washington DC said Tuesday that the agency hasnt made any decision yet whether it will propose the blanket delisting An agency report last year proposed dropping wolves from the endangered list in most areas where theyre known not to liveEven if the Fish and Wildlife Service ends federal protections Tollefson said states would be free to cultivate their own wolf populations Its fair to say that there wouldnt be a prohibition it would simply be left to the states to determine how to manage wolves in their boundaries he saidTollefson said his agency regards the wolf recovery efforts in the Great Lakes states and Northern Rockies as enormous successesOur view and that of the biological community is that those populations are thriving and no longer require the protections of the Endangered Species Act Tollefson said Obviously well be discussing other areas

and Wildlife Service this week disqualified many of the nations leading wolf researchers from participating in the scientific peer review of the agencys proposal to end federal protections for gray wolves across most of the lower 48 states The scientists are being excluded from the peer review which is required for all proposals to give or remove protection to species because they signed a letter calling into question some of the science behind an advanced version of the proposal that was leaked to the press In total 16 leading wolf scientists signed the letter and are excluded from the reviewThe future of wolf recovery in the United States is at stake here and the Fish and Wildlife Service ought to be seeking advice from the very best wolf experts we have said Brett Hartl endangered species policy director with the Center for Biological Diversity This is like a hospital excluding its top doctors from deciding on the best way to save a patients lifePeer review is critical in ensuring that federal protections are not lifted before a species is fully recovered In the case of the wolf the Fish and Wildlife Service is contracting with a private company to conduct the peer review Recognizing their scientific expertise the contractor hired for the review contacted several of the signers to the letter to participate in the review including Dr John Vucetich Dr Robert Wayne and Dr Roland Kays but then at the direction of the agency rescinded the invitations Fish and Wildlife argues (http://wwwbiologicaldiversityorg/campaigns/gray_wolves/pdfs/Wolf_Delisting_RFP_Statement_of_Workpdf) that these scientists have an unacceptable affiliation with an advocacy positionThe decision to end wolf protections should be based on a critical evaluation of the science but that wont happen if dissenting opinions are excluded before the conversation even starts said Hartl These scientists arent chaining themselves to trees or blockading the entrance to the Department of the Interior theyre merely trying to make sure that the best available science truly informs policyThis is the first time the Fish and Wildlife Service has excluded scientists simply because they had advocated for a particular position based on their scientific expertise In a review of a 2012 proposal to designate critical habitat for the northern spotted owl for example the agency included 40 scientists a number of whom had spoken out for stronger protections for the owl to review the proposal No scientists were disqualified from the review Now in a clear attempt to limit meaningful scientific comment the peer review process may become nothing more than an empty formalityThe letter from the scientists and another (http://wwwbiologicaldiversityorg/campaigns/gray_wolves/pdfs/ASM-2013-Wolf-Delisting-letterpdf) from the American Society of Mammalogists raised a number of scientific questions about the agencys proposal to remove protections for wolves In particular they questioned how wolves could be considered recovered when the species is absent from significant portions its range and a determination by the Service that there are two species of wolves in the United States the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and the eastern wolf (Canis lycaon) These are important questions that should be thoroughly vettedBackground on Scientists Excluded from Review:The following scientists have been excluded based on the Services new restrictions on peer reviewers with an affiliation with advocacy because each of them signed onto a letter to the Service raising scientific concerns about the Services proposal to delist the wolf:- Dr John Vucetich of Michigan Technological University Vucetich has been studying the wolves of Isle Royale National Park for the last 20 years and is one of nations leading wolf researchers Vucetich was a member of the Mexican wolf recovery team and in 2011 participated as a peer reviewer of the Services decision to drop federal protections for the gray wolf in Wyoming- Dr Robert Wayne of the University of California Los Angeles Wayne is a leading

450,Approximately One Million Americans Speak Out Against Stripping Federal Protections From Wolves,Y,12/17/2013,After,Targeted News Servic,https://uwyoidmoclcorg/login?url=https://wwwproquestcom/usnews/wire-feeds/approximately-one-million-americans-speak-out/docview/1468846846/sem-2?accountid=14793,Wolf delisting AND Idaho,"Approximately one million Americans stated their opposition to the Obama administration's proposal to strip endangered species protections from gray wolves in a comment period that closed today. This is one of the largest numbers of comments ever submitted on a federal decision involving endangered species and reflects broad dissatisfaction with the Obama administration's politically driven move to turn wolf management over to states across most of the lower 48. ""Americans overwhelmingly oppose removing protections for wolves, and for good reason. Wolves have recovered to just a fraction of their range and are severely threatened by state-sanctioned hunts intended to decimate them,"" said Kieran Suckling, executive director at the Center for Biological Diversity. ""We hope the Obama administration will hear the pleas of hundreds of thousands of citizens and maintain these still critically needed protections for wolves."" The 750,000+ comments, being delivered today to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by multiple conservation groups, will bring the total number to well over one million. There were once up to 2 million gray wolves living in North America, but the animals had been driven to near-extinction in the lower 48 states by the early 1900s. After passage of the federal Endangered Species Act in 1973 and protection of the wolf as endangered, federal recovery programs resulted in the rebound of wolf populations in limited parts of the country. Roughly 5,500 wolves currently live in the continental United States--a fraction of the species' historic numbers. ""The North American gray wolf's recovery in certain areas of the United States is something to celebrate, but an abundance of evidence shows the work is not yet complete,"" said International Fund for Animal Welfare president and CEO Azzedine Downes. ""I applaud actions to help protect this critical species, and I strongly urge the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to not go through with this proposal."" The Obama administration's proposal would remove existing protections for wolves everywhere except Arizona and New Mexico, where the Mexican wolf is struggling to survive with an estimated population of just 75 wolves. This proposal would abandon protections for wolves in places where wolf recovery is just in its infancy, such as Oregon and Washington, and would prevent wolves from recovering in other places where good wolf habitat has been identified, including northern California, the southern Rocky Mountains, and the Northeast. ""Oregon wolves have taken the first tentative steps towards recovery in the last few years,"" said Sean Stevens, executive director with Oregon Wild. ""If the Obama administration takes away the strong protections of the Endangered Species Act, we pull the rug out from the fragile success story here on the West Coast and leave the fate of wolves in the hands of state agencies in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming who have proven incapable of balanced management."" ""The restoration of the gray wolf could be one of the great American wildlife conservation success stories if Secretary Jewel would just finish the job."" Leda Huta, executive director of the Endangered Species Coalition.
Nicole Paquette, vice president of Wildlife Protection for The Humane Society of the United States said: ""Anti-wolf sentiments nearly led to the extermination of America's wolves, and just when populations are starting to bounce back, the federal government is considering a plan that could place them in jeopardy. Rather than catering to interests from trophy hunters and fear mongering, we hope the federal government rejects this proposal and works towards the recovery of this species."" ""The incredible volume of comments give voice to a sad fact: the delisting proposal is a radical departure from the optimism and courage we need to promote endangered species recovery in this country. The comments show that Americans believe the Fish and Wildlife Service's proposal falls well short of the conservation ideals this country stood for 40 years ago when the Endangered Species Act was signed."" said Defenders of Wildlife President Jamie Rappaport Clark. ""The national wolf delisting scheme is simply too much, too soon,"" said NRDC President Frances Beinecke. ""It is a potential death sentence for new populations and prevents wolves from ever reaching areas where they could be a boon for habitat in need of their stabilizing influence. The return of wolves to the continental United States still stands as one of the greatest conservation stories ever written and we stand ready to fight to prevent it from being undone by this short-sighted policy move."" ""Americans are outraged and hundreds of thousands are saying it loudly and clearly; the job of wolf recovery is not done,"" said John Horning Executive Director of WildEarth Guardians. ""The Fish and Wildlife Service is not only wildlife wrong on the science of wolf recovery but also wildly out of step with the desires of most Americans who want to see federal protections for wolves maintained."" ""The number of public comments is a testament to the importance of wolves to our American story. Now is the time we should be pressing in to continue the job of wolf recovery, not abandoning wolves to the same kinds of destructive forces that endangered them in the first place,"" said Dan Chu, director of Sierra Club's Our Wild America Campaign. ""You don't spend 40 years nursing a species back from the brink of extinction, only to suddenly declare 'open season' on them. There are only a few dozen viable packs in an area that used to be home to over a millions wolves. There's plenty of room in America for wolves, people and an abundance of other species. But If Secretary Jewell allows this plan to go ahead, she'll be responsible for the destruction of one of the most amazing, intelligent and iconic species in America."" said Drew Hudson, Environmental Action. Camilla Fox, Executive Director, Project Coyote said: ""As wolves come under the gun in an upcoming wolf/coyote killing 'derby' in Idaho where prizes awarded for the largest killed, it is abundantly clear that the very practices that sent wolves to the brink of extinction still endanger their persistence."" ""Fish and Wildlife Service is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Instead of restoring wolves to their rightful places from coast to coast--as it did for bald eagles--the agency wants to abandon wolf recovery before the job is done,"" said Trip Van Noppen, Earthjustice president. ""Today hundreds of thousands of citizens told FWS to go back to work and protect our wolves.""",Montana Idaho Endangered Species Act De-listing Wolf Wyoming Gray Wolves Recovery Protections Hunting,NGO,John Horning Executive Director of WildEarth Guardians,Americans are outraged and hundreds of thousands are saying it loudly and clearly; the job of wolf recovery is not done said John Horning Executive Director of WildEarth Guardians The Fish and Wildlife Service is not only wildlife wrong on the science of wolf recovery but also wildly out of step with the desires of most Americans who want to see federal protections for wolves maintained

said Don Barry executive vice president of Defenders of Wildlife Whether a species is heading toward extinction is a scientific calculation It is not a political oneThe wildlife service already has delisted wolves for the Great Lakes and Wyoming but federal judges have ruled these changes are premature under suits filed by Defenders and other groups Those rulings prompted Wisconsin Congressman Reid Ribble a Republican to introduce HR884 directing the Interior to finalize the delisting rulesBut Barry noted Fish and Wildlife has made no final determination whether to delist wolves nationally so the logic supporting HR884 cannot be applied to Utah which has documented only itinerant wolvesA far-roaming female from Wyoming was killed Dec 28 after a bounty hunter mistook her for a coyoteAnd last fall photos confirmed the presence of a male wolf on the south slope of the Uinta MountainsBenson has made a good living promoting a Big Bad Wolf narrativeBig Game Forever paid Benson $190000 and Peay $90000 in 2012 according to financial disclosures filed with the IRSWhatever its funding from Utahs Legislature the groups claims that wolves are running amok in Idaho eradicating big game have little basis in science critics saySince 2009 wolf numbers have plateaued in the Northern Rockies to about 1700 animals in 320 packs according to Fish and WildlifeAnd the National Park Service says Yellowstone wolf numbers peaked in 2003 at 175 and have since slipped to half that manyThose numbers still far exceed federal recovery goals but they are nowhere near the 4000 wolves that Big Game Forever says stalk the regionIdahos elk declines particularly in the Lolo region in the states Panhandle are largely due to habitat changes according to Dan MacNulty a Utah State University wildlife biologist who studies wolvesThe Big Burn wildfire of 1910 not only gave rise to a fledgling US Forest Service and its fire-fighting mission but also transformed parts of the Northern Rockies into great habitat for elk whose numbers soared during the very decades hunters rid the landscape of big predatorsA policy of fire suppression also changed the forests in ways that dont favor elk allowing conifers to encroach into open meadows MacNulty said And spring green-ups occur more quickly now leaving elk cows insufficient time to bulk up on nutritious grassesWolves kill elk calves MacNulty said They will have an effect but is secondary to these bottom-up effectsSalt Lake City Democratic Rep Joel Briscoe and other House Democrats were incensed that the wolf appropriation which the Division of Wildlife Resources did not seek advanced without a hearingIf its that needed why not do it in public like everyone else?

meaning they are not a discrete population as defined under ESAThe need to delist is supported by your assertion in the proposed rule that ESA does not require us to restore the gray wolf to all of its historical range or even to a majority of its current suitable habitat Instead the Act requires that we recover listed species such that they no longer meet the definitions of threatened species or endangered species  although C lupus (gray wolf) has undergone significant range contraction in portions of its historical range the species continues to be widespread and as a whole stable We have found no substantial evidence to suggest that gray wolves are at risk of extinction throughout their global range now or are likely to become so in the foreseeable futureFederal environmental and species management policies must be based on the best available science In addition to scientific data showing significant increases to the number of wolves nationally the proposed rule also recognizes a number of significant changes in scientists understanding of the taxonomy and historic habitat in the 37 years since the gray wolf was first listed as endangeredAs the proposed rule clearly shows full delisting of the gray wolf is long overdue Since wolves were first provided protections under ESA uncontrolled and unmanaged growth of wolf populations has resulted in devastating impacts on hunting and ranching as well as tragic losses to historically strong and healthy livestock and wildlife populationsThe failure by USFWS to fully delist the gray wolf has also led to decreased social tolerance and has hurt the ability of many states to maintain this critically-important facet of successful wolf recovery This complex issue includes various considerations - from social to economic and political - and a states ability to manage their gray wolf population relies on the input and buy-in of a variety of stakeholders who can be disenfranchised by the failure to remove problem wolves (lethally or through other means)We believe that state governments are fully qualified to responsibly manage gray wolf populations and are better able to meet the needs of local communities ranchers livestock and wildlife populations Delisting the gray wolf under ESA would allow state wildlife officials to more effectively manage wolf populations -

Montana,WildEarth Guardians and a coalition of Western wolf advocates represented by the Western Environmental Law Center challenged the US Fish and Wildlife Services (the Service) decision to prematurely strip wolves of federal protections in the contiguous 48 states in violation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA)The most recent data from the Service and its state partners show an estimated 4400 wolves inhabit the western Great Lakes states but there are only 108 wolves in Washington state (with only 20 outside of eastern Washington) 158 in Oregon (with only 16 outside of northeastern Oregon) and a scant 15 exist in California Nevada Utah and Colorado have had a few wolf sightings over the past three years but wolves remain essentially absent from their historical habitat in these statesAs a direct result of human persecution wolves became functionally extinct across the contiguous US in the 1960s said Sarah McMillan conservation director at WildEarth Guardians Wolf reintroduction into Yellowstone in the mid-1990s was the start of an amazing effort to restore this keystone species to its historic range an effort that is nowhere near completion The Service may not claim victory and throw up its hands in the middle of recovery efforts even if wolf management is challenging and has become a political hot potato This directly contradicts the plain language and the intent of the ESAIn delisting wolves the Service ignored the science showing wolves are not recovered in the West The Service concluded that because in its belief there are sufficient wolves in the Great Lakes states it does not matter that wolves in the West are not yet recovered The Endangered Species Act demands more including restoring the species in the ample suitable habitats afforded by the wild public lands throughout the West Indeed wolves are listed as endangered under state laws in Washington and California and wolves only occupy a small portion of available suitable habitat in Oregon Likewise wolves have only just begun to recolonize their historical wild public lands habitat in much of the West including in Colorado and the southern RockiesWe have seen what happens when management of wolves is returned to hostile state wildlife agencies disinterested in maintaining robust stable and genetically diverse wolf populations said Lindsay Larris wildlife program director at WildEarth Guardians Idaho which allows an individual to kill up to 30 wolves annually saw the slaughter of nearly 600 wolves and wolf pups in a recent 12-month period Now other states are gearing up to allow wolf hunting and trapping this fall Returning this type of unscientific and barbaric management to states at this early juncture would spell disaster for true gray wolf recovery plain and simpleThe conservation groups have long been active on wolf recovery issues in the American West including working with Western states to develop science-based wolf management plans mounting cases to rein in rogue federal government wolf-killing programs promoting recovery efforts in the Southwest for critically imperiled Mexican gray wolves and working with local governments and landowners to deploy non-lethal tools that prevent wolf-livestock conflictsWhile the Trump administration may believe it can disregard science to promote purely political listing decisions the law does not support such a stance The best available science says gray wolves are not recovered and the coalition looks forward to having a court hear science-based arguments supporting the necessity of ongoing Endangered Species Act protections to allow wolves to truly recover across the species rangeWolves are a keystone species whose presence on landscapes regulates animal populations and improves ecosystem health--something the Service has acknowledged for at least 44 years said Kelly Nokes Western Environmental Law Center attorney Allowing people to kill wolves in Idaho Wyoming and Montana has already stunted recovery in those states Applying this same death sentence to wolves throughout the contiguous US would nationalize these negative effects with potentially catastrophic ripple effects on ecosystems where wolves have yet to fully recoverThe coalition of western wildlife advocates launching this legal challenge includes WildEarth Guardians Western Watersheds Project Cascadia

Montana,Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship Oakton Virginia has issued a public comment to the US Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service The comment was written on May 15 2023 and posted on May 18 2023The comment on Docket No FWS-R6-ES-2022-0150-0001 was sent to Secretary Deb Haaland* * *On behalf of our more than 23000 members nationwide and the 50-year bipartisan legacy of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship (CRS) asks that you reject the petitions by the states of Montana and Wyoming to delist grizzly bear populations in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE) and in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE)Based on how these two states along with neighboring Idaho have aggressively reduced the Northern Rocky Mountain gray wolf population over the past decade post delisting--more than 500 were killed just last year--CRS has zero confidence that these states would act in good faith to properly manage a healthy grizzly bear population if the bear is delistedToday wolves are essentially being treated as pests in these states which is in blatant violation of assurances given to the USFWS prior to delisting In fact not since wolves were hunted and trapped to near-extinction a century ago has this nation witnessed such a bloodlust-driven assault on a predator species Grizzlies would face the same tragic fate once delistedEven if--and it is a big if--professionals in the Montana and Wyoming wildlife agencies do have noble intentions and want to properly manage a predator population they are at the mercy of politicians who openly seek the extermination of predators and predator populations greatly reducedMontana for example has recently passed laws that financially incentivize hunters and allow for killing up to 85 percent of the wolf population Over the past three hunting seasons in Montana roughly 860 gray wolves have been killedIn Wyoming which has fewer wolves than Montana wolves are designated as predatory animals on a year-round basis and may be killed without a licenseIn fact far from celebrating the species recovery under the ESA and preserving the progress made all evidence suggests that the sole purpose of these delisting petitions is to reduce the grizzly bear population in each state to the minimum number possible without triggering a relistingClearly the authors of the ESA did not intend nor did the recovery targets established under it anticipate that the act of delisting recovered species would be used as a green light for the same type of wholesale slaughter that necessitated the species being listed in the first placeRegarding assertions made in the petitions CRS strongly disagrees with petitioners claim that none of the five specific listing factors that are contained in Section 4(a)(l) of the Act are currently being metFactor (A) the present or threatened destruction modification or curtailment of its habitat or range is most certainly being met due to increased climate change impacts that include changes in food availability hotter weather drought and a significant increase in wildfire riskFactor (D) the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms is met due to demonstrated results from the gray wolf delisting Both states along with neighboring Idaho have passed laws or enacted policies designed to dramatically reduce the wolf population Management assurances from state wildlife agencies have been rendered invalid due to these new laws and policies Based on that record and the stated desire of elected officials to aggressively reduce predator populations CRS is convinced that the same fate would await grizzliesNeither a genius nor a mind reader is required to see through the motives behind Montana and Wyomings strong desire to get control of managing grizzly bearsIt is also important to note that the GYE spans multiple states (ID MT and WY) and its grizzlies roam throughout a wide area and regularly cross state lines At present there is no adequate regulatory mechanism to ensure consistent management across all three states if grizzly bears are delisted The amended Tri-State Memorandum of Agreement cited by petitioners cannot protect grizzly bear populations from legislative action aimed at reducing population numbers beyond the targets agreed to in the MOAFurthermore that Tri-State MOA only seeks to protect minimum population levels necessary for genetic and reproductive purposes It does not commit to maintaining a truly healthy viable and growing population At those minimal numbers the population would be extremely vulnerable to decline based on any number of factors ranging from legal and/or illegal hunting/baiting and traffic deaths to drought heat disease wildfire and food shortages And nothing in the MOA can protect bears against state legislation to reduce numbers much lowerThe same problem exists between federal and state jurisdictions As was gruesomely demonstrated last year with the killing of 25 Yellowstone National Park wolves--roughly one fifth of the park population--as they naturally wandered beyond park boundaries Absent ESA listing neither Yellowstone National Park nor Glacier National Park in the NCDE have any regulatory mechanism that can protect park grizzly bears from being killed outside of national park boundariesDespite state assurances to manage grizzly bear populations properly one does not have to look hard--even as the USFWS is evaluating the petitions--to see clues as to the true motives for seeking delistingMontana Senator Bruce Butch Gillespie who sponsored legislation (SB 98) last session allowing the killing of grizzly bears for reasons inconsistent with the ESA said Its time to take a healthy strong look at getting them delisted and getting the numbers under Montana management not federal so that we can solve our own problems hereIn neighboring Idaho part of the GYE Governor Brad Little recently stated we have robust grizzly bear populations that continue to cause conflict in our rural communities and injure Idahos sovereign interests in managing our resident wildlife and conservation resourcesThe clear goal here just as with the gray wolf is to significantly reduce the number of grizzly bears and there is no regulatory mechanism other than listing under the ESA that will prevent these states from relentlessly pursuing that goalCRS also strongly opposes the petitioners request to divide up grizzlies in the GYC and NCDE into distinct populations The current grizzly bear range in the Lower 48 is still a miniscule fraction of the bears historic range dividing the remaining--and still recovering--population into even smaller islands of management runs counter to the stated goals of the ESAFederally managed lands between GYE and NCDE provide sufficient unbroken habitat that is sufficient to augment and bridge the two populations This greatly serves the goal of species recovery with adequate genetic variation Having the bears protected through this entire corridor is far more conducive to a healthy population and its long-term genetic health than state wildlife officials commitment in their MOA to periodically translocat a couple bears from outside the areaThe grizzly bear population in the region and in the Lower 48 as a whole remains at only a tiny fraction of its historic size and range The underlying purpose of the ESA with respect to this iconic species would be undermined by granting these delisting petitionsTurning management over to Montana and Wyoming would ultimately be a replay of the ongoing wolf slaughter we see playing out in the region every day And further fragmenting grizzly bear habitat would be an equally disastrous development for the long term health of the speciesFamous conservative theorist Russell Kirk once correctly noted There is nothing more conservative than conservation These petitions as they seek to undermine responsible conservation are not conservative they are misguided and uninformed exercises of parochial interests that stand in direct conflict with the ESAPresident Nixon as he signed the ESA into law pointed out that nothing is more priceless and more worthy of preservation than the rich array of animal life with which our country has been blessedIt is in that spirit and on this 50th anniversary year of the ESA that CRS requests that the Biden Administration USFWS and DOI reject the Montana and Wyoming grizzly bear delisting petitionsThank you for considering these commentsSincerelyDavid JenkinsPresident,Montana

newborns even poisoned Numerous wolves were found with shattered teeth from chewing on the traps in a struggle to free themselves fractured feet and missing limbs from being left in unattended traps and others were found with festering wounds from snares still embedded in their necks Other nontarget animals including wolverine fisher mountain lions bobcats and even pet dogs have been killed in

232,11 Wolf Reintroduction Team Members Issue Public Comment to Interior Dept,Y,10/30/2023,After,Targeted News Service,https://uwyoidmoclcorg/login?url=https://wwwproquestcom/usnews/wire-feeds/11-wolf-reintroduction-team-members-issue-public/docview/2883502554/sem-2?accountid=14793,Wolf delisting AND Idaho,We represent the state tribal and federal government and nongovernmental organizations wolf reintroduction team members who restored wolves to central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s Many of us still work live recreate fish and hunt in the region The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho symbolized a new era of rewilding and has contributed to strengthening the regions ecological health It was an arduous and expensive journey to rebuild the gray wolf population in the western United States after they were extirpated in the early 1900sToday the wolf population in Idaho is again being exterminated from the state through year-round hunting aggressive trapping and snaring the killing of pups a commercial reimbursement (aka bounty) program and through annual aerial gunning This is occurring due to political and social intolerance in Idaho almost identical to that which led to the complete eradication of wolves in the state a century ago We request that you issue an emergency listing to restore federal protection through the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to the Northern Rocky Mountain Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of the gray wolf The case for doing so is clear: inadequate regulatory mechanisms governing human-caused mortality and overutilization of commercial and recreational mortality constitute an emergency need to prevent the dismantling of the Northern Rockies wolf metapopulationUnder the provision of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) a species is added to the list when it is determined to be an endangered or threatened species because of any of the following factors:* the present or threatened destruction modification or curtailment of its habitat or range;* overutilization for commercial recreational scientific or educational purposes;* disease or predation;* the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms;* other natural or manmade factors affecting its survivalThe Northern Rocky Mountain gray wolf population (Distinct Population Segment) was established as a metapopulation of three subpopulations (central Idaho northwestern Montana and the Yellowstone ecosystem) Later eastern Oregon eastern Washington and a portion of northern Utah were added however these do not represent robust independent wolf populations and their connectivity through Idaho is now largely severed due to the intense hunting pressure on wolves within Idaho (ODFW WDFW citations)Once the three core Northern Rockies subpopulations met federal recovery goals the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) began the rule-making process to delist wolves ceding management to states The Services 2009 Final Rule ultimately became law in Idaho and Montana when Congress attached a rider to federal budget legislation However the 2009 Rule contained standards designed to ensure the states maintain adequate regulatory mechanisms as well as viable and interconnected wolf subpopulations When the Department of Interior delisted (removed) wolves from federal protection in 2009 the agency promised to maintain authority to restore federal protection at any point if a State changed their regulatory framework to authorize unlimited and unregulated taking of wolves a condition determined threatened a wolf population Specifically the USFWS (United States Fish and Wildlife Service) 2009 Delisting Rule issued in the Federal Register (vol 74 no 62) Final Gray Wolf Delisting Rule (page 15148) states:While our post-delisting monitoring window is 5 years meaningful changes in State law or management objectives that would significantly increase the threat to the wolf population could lead to reconsideration of listing including the potential for emergency listing at any point For example if a State changed their regulatory framework to authorize the unlimited and unregulated taking of wolves a condition we have previously determined threatened a wolf population emergency listing would be immediately pursued (Issue 31 of Federal Register / Vol 74 No 62 / Thursday April 2 2009)Unregulated and unlimited killing of wolves in IdahoAt the time of delisting the State of Idaho hosted the largest contiguous wolf subpopulation making it the strongest leg of the stool that represents the Northern Rockies wolf metapopulation Hunting and trapping of wolves were both limited and regulated from 2010 to 2021 On May 5 2021 Idaho Governor Brad Little signed Senate Bill 1211 which authorized unregulated and unlimited killing of wolves across the state Specifically this legislation allows for any method utilized for the take of any wild canine in Idaho shall be available for the taking of wolves The State of Idaho allows the use of incentive payments for each dead wolf traps snares night raids using heat sensitive scopes hunting hounds using ATVs and snowmobiles to run over and kill wolves and even the killing of nursing age pups and their mothers There is no limit to the number of tags people can buy to kill wolves and all tags are valid in any open season and any unit and almost all game management units in the core wolf habitat run year-round Additionally trapping and snaring is allowed from September 10 through March 31 across most of the core wolf range statewide Big Game Seasons and Rules Brochure | Idaho Fish and GameAccording to the Idaho Department of Fish and Games wolf mortality records shared with the public (see attached) there are countless examples of wolves and their pups killed in traps and snares left unchecked beyond the 72-hour requirement significant injuries and maiming evidence of litters of pups being killed for reimbursement payments (aka commercial bounty) poisoning and more The reimbursement payment program has utilized state funding to pay up to $2500 per wolf which encompasses all age groups including newborn pups Further there is no reliable means for maintaining an accurate and timely population count when numbers are in rapid decline or at the population levels falling below 500 animals statewide as the objective in the new 2023-2028 state wolf management planStatewide livestock losses due to wolves reported in 2020 and 2021 fall below 0002% of the states cattle and sheep inventory with an annual average of only 48 confirmed and probable livestock injuries and mortalities due to wolves over the last 5 years (p 26 Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan 2023-2-28) Even using the multiplier of one livestock found for every 67 killed (Oakleaf et al 2003) livestock losses to wolves statewide represent only 0013 percent The State of Idaho defines chronic conflict as only one or more livestock loss in an entire game management unit annually Bounty or reimbursement payments and government lethal control efforts are increased in chronic conflict areas That means that wolf packs with no livestock conflicts fall under the same increased mortality pressure as packs involved in only one or more livestock losses Additionally 2022 marked the eighth year in a row where elk harvest eclipsed 20000 which has happened only one other time dating back to the 1930s The drive to kill more wolves is excessive considering the relatively minor impacts to the State of Idaho and most of its residentsThere are more effective and less costly alternatives to this draconian approach to predator management The Wood River Wolf Project in Idaho is a case study of alternative nonlethal methods to minimize livestock losses to wolves Across the region and despite lower sheep numbers present on rangelands historically wolves have killed far more sheep than cattle as they are more vulnerable to predation For example USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) Wildlife Services reports more than 5000 sheep annually lost to coyotes in Idaho (USDA Idaho sheep and lamb losses 2018) sheep and lamb losses_2018pdf (usdagov) Wolves are responsible for fewer than 200 sheep losses per year in Idaho yet the state is spending one million dollars exclusively to kill wolves There is no bounty program for other large predators no concerted effort by the state to drive down coyote numbers that are estimated at 30-50k statewide and no effort to increase trapping and snaring of coyotes We make this point not to demonize coyotes which also play a vital role in biodiversity protection and healthy ecosystem function but to expose that the level of persecution aimed at wolves is unjustified and archaicIf the State of Idaho genuinely wanted to minimize livestock losses to wolves it would fund a proactive nonlethal program like the Wood River Wolf Project which provides sheep producers with direct field support to implement effective methods to protect sheep from predation Since 2007 stakeholders who created the project have worked together to design and test these methods including increased livestock guarding dogs per band monitoring wolf activity avoiding grazing close to den and rendezvous sites increased human presence at night when predators are most active and devices like Foxlights and alarms that deter predators from coming too close to sheep bands at night The Project has maintained records of sheep in their protected area of 1200 sq km (about half the area of Yosemite National Park) since 2008 from 10000 - 25000 sheep and average losses of sheep to wolves remains under 5 sheep annually (Stone et al 2017) while wolves lethally controlled by agencies remain at only two wolves out of the 3 - 6 packs documented annually over this 16-year study Program funding to conduct these measures is under 100k annually and includes private donations and grants from county and federal wildlife programs Clearly there are better alternatives for managing wolves than just killing themFlawed Wolf Population Assessment Methods Inflate NumbersFurther the emergency relisting is necessary because reliable wolf population estimates in Idaho do not currently exist and are essential to understand how Idahos ongoing unregulated killing is affecting the wolf population Yet the method described in the Camera-Based Estimation of Statewide Wolf Abundance in Idaho 2019-2021 Interim Report would allow a large population decline to go undetected These population estimates were derived from a space-to-event (STE) model fit to data from motion-sensitive camera traps STE is designed for time-lapse camera traps set to take photographs at fixed times not for data from cameras triggered by animal motion Further this model is based on random placement of cameras not cameras placed at known den and rendezvous sites as Idaho has done which invalidates the population assessment Similar flaws are inherent in Montanas population assessment resulting in underestimating territory size thus its use in the states Integrated Patch Occupancy Model iPOM will systematically overestimate the number of packs that occupy a fixed area and thus overestimate population size (Creel 2022)We are also deeply concerned that the State of Idaho failed to consult with the Nez Perce Tribe which played a key role as the initial wolf monitoring team in Idaho and still retains authority in managing Idahos wolves per the joint 2005 Memorandum of Agreement However according to the letter dated July 25 2023 the State of Idaho created new wolf population goals harvest goals and harvest objectives without coordinating with the Tribe Idahos actions are a significant threat to wolves especially so given that current wolf mortality is also a concern in Montana and WyomingMontana Following in Idahos FootstepsOnce a model for moderation in wolf management among Rocky Mountain states Montana has shifted sharply to an extreme management regime after the 2020 election Governor Greg Gianforte loaded his wildlife commission with special interest cronies with little experience or qualification while encouraging a conservative majority in the state legislature to pass laws that allow extreme and controversial means for killing more wolves These measures include snaring (previously banned for decades in Montana) night-hunting with special technology and the bounties paid by private groups that have infected neighboring states They have even failed to close a loophole allowing hunters to use radio telemetry to track and kill wolves that were collared for researchManagement response has been to liberalize harvest under dubious justifications Do wolves attack humans? No they are timid animals that rarely approach people making attacks exceedingly rare Will wolves kill most of the game animals? No wolves are selective predators that primarily prey on the unhealthy margins of prey populations Montanas elk population was recently estimated at 141785 a number exceeding the states own objective by more than 50000 animals Do wolves kill a lot of livestock? No Montana has 27 million cows and sheep Recently wolves killed only 90 (0003%) the value of those were compensated by the state Even adding a multiplier for undetected losses clearly wolves are not a threat to the livestock industry And there are effective nonlethal methods available to all livestock producers who wish to proactively protect their livestock from wolves bears coyotes mountain lions and other native predators One must only look to the Blackfoot Challenges record of livestock loss to wolves (calves and sheep) at 22 livestock per year Their proactive conflict prevention methods include electric fencing to protect calves livestock carcass removal minimum lethal control of wolves (24 per year/15-17 wolf packs) and range riders to maintain low levels of livestock losses to wolves since 2008 (Wilson et al 2017)Citing the need to manage the wolf population the State of Montana has targeted them for problems unsupported by any convincing evidence No reliable estimate of the states population exists while an assumption of overpopulation has dominated the discussion Wolves will regulate their own population through competition and natural mortality Under Park protection Yellowstone wolves have been remarkably stable at around 100 for over a decade without detriment to the ecological community and drive an $82 million ecotourism industry in gateway townsWyoming the Last Leg of the Three-Legged StoolWyomings wolf population was not managed by the state until 2012 and even then they were relisted under the ESA in 2014 because a federal judge found that Wyomings management plan and shoot on sight policies were not sufficient for wolf protection In 2017 a DC Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower courts decision and wolves were once again returned to state management under a plan that was almost identical to the one rejected by the USFWS (United States Fish and Wildlife Service) in 2009 for not being protective enough to sustain a minimum viable subpopulation of wolves In 85% of the state wolves can still be killed without bag limits and without a license year-round They are listed as a predator and are not managed by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department but rather by the Wyoming Department of Agriculture Very few wolf packs exist outside of the Gray Wolf Trophy Game Management Area in Wyoming which has severely limited wolves ability to migrate south and east into Colorado Utah and eastern Wyoming As a result Colorado must reintroduce wolves because too few wolves have dispersed through Wyoming into Colorado preventing their recovery in the region However Wyoming cannot host a metapopulation of wolves alone It is important that all three states maintain an interconnected and healthy subpopulation for the Northern Rockies wolf recovery to ensure a healthy metapopulationWe the undersigned urge you to follow the provisions of the Final Gray Wolf Delisting Rule concerning the unlimited and unregulated taking of wolves currently underway in Idaho coupled with our concerns over management direction in Wyoming and Montana and issue an emergency listing under the Endangered Species Act for wolves in the Northern Rocky MountainsSigned by:John D Varley -

225,Conservation Groups Challenge Federal Decision to Deny Western Wolves Protections,Y,4/9/2024,After,Targeted News Service,https://uwyoidmoclcorg/login?url=https://wwwproquestcom/usnews/wire-feeds/conservation-groups-challenge-federal-decision/docview/3035299334/sem-2?accountid=14793,Wolf delisting AND Idaho,Today 10 conservation groups challenged the US Fish and Wildlife Service (the Service) over its failure to list western wolves under the Endangered Species Act The Services not warranted finding ignores obvious threats to the species runs contrary to the best available science and relies on flawed population models for its determinationThe US Fish and Wildlife Service is supposed to be the backstop for imperiled species like the gray wolf said Lizzy Pennock carnivore coexistence attorney at WildEarth Guardians Instead the Service decided that wolves in the Western US do not qualify for federal protections while Montana Idaho and Wyoming openly try to manage wolves to the brink of local extinction Wolves and the American people deserve better from this agencyIn its not warranted finding the Service confirmed that a western US distinct population segment (DPS) is a valid entity for listing consideration but cites a deeply flawed modeling exercise to conclude there is no risk of extinction for wolves in the West either now or in the foreseeable future A 2023 study  by Dr Robert Crabtree and others found the Montana state population model was badly biased overestimating total wolf populations by as much as 50% These researchers found this flawed population model constitutes a precariously misleading situation for decision-makers that threatens wolf populations In an earlier analysis Dr Scott Creel found that data (https://westernwatershedsorg/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Creel-Wolf-Report_FINALpdf) used in both the Idaho and Montana population models violate the assumptions of the models meaning population estimations generated by the models are unreliable Yet the Service relied on these flawed population estimates to conclude wolves in the West are not at risk of extinctionA second 2023 study by wolf geneticist Dr Bridgett vonHoldt and others found wolf populations in the northern Rockies are losing genetic variability and below genetic minimum viable population levels at todays populations At present wolf populations in California and the Cascade Range of western Oregon and Washington are far below minimum viable population thresholds and Utah Nevada and northern Arizona all of which have historic gray wolf habitat have no wolves at allThe current killing regimes in Idaho Montana and Wyoming put wolves at obvious risk of extinction in the foreseeable future and this core population is key to wolf survival in the West said Erik Molvar a wildlife biologist and executive director of Western Watersheds Project The US Fish and Wildlife Service is playing politics pretending that the anti-wolf agendas of state governments constitute adequate conservation regulations and that the small and vulnerable condition of fledgling wolf populations elsewhere in the West somehow protect the species from extinctionThe Services finding seems to give the green light for states hostile to wolves to follow suit with Idaho Montana and Wyomings aggressive killing regimes if they are eventually delisted and transferred to state management West wide said Kelly Nokes an attorney with the Western Environmental Law Center representing the groups But wolves have yet to recover across vast portions of the West and they exist in only small populations in the West Coast and Colorado habitats they are slowly reinhabiting This legal challenge asks only for the protections needed for this iconic species to be rightfully restored across the Wests wild landscapes--protections that some states have shown only the Endangered Species Act can really provideIdaho Montana and Wyoming have become the poster children for what happens when politics trumps science said Brooks Fahy executive director of Predator Defense Science shows us the importance of intact pack structures the vital role each family member plays But these states are destroying wolf families in the Northern Rockies and cruelly driving them to functional extinction via bounties wanton shooting trapping snaring even running over them with snowmobiles They have clearly demonstrated they are incapable of managing wolves only of killing themIts deeply concerning to hear that the US Fish and Wildlife Service has decided not to list gray wolves a sacred species to Native Americans in the western US under the Endangered Species Act while ignoring traditional sacred religious beliefs of Native Americans said Roger Dobson with Protect The Wolves Its important to protect these intelligent and family-oriented predators to maintain ecosystem health and to protect Native Americans sacred religious beliefs Hopefully the Service will take steps to address these issues with its determination before its too late for these native wildlife species and before violating Indigenous religious beliefsThe US Fish and Wildlife Service committed to immediately pursue emergency Endangered Species Act listing of wolves if any state allowed unlimited and unregulated killing of wolves which Idaho has done since July 1 2021 said Suzanne Asha Stone director of the Idaho-based International Wildlife Coexistence Network The Service has failed to honor its delisting plan just as the state of Idaho has failed to manage wolves like mountain lions and black bears as they publicly swore to do before wolf delisting Aerial gunning of animals killing pups for bounties and widespread traps and deadly snares have no place in responsible wildlife management todayMontana Idaho and Wyoming know that they were let off the hook in their brutal and unethical destruction of wolves even acknowledged as such by the Service said KC York founder and president of Trap Free Montana They set the stage for other states to follow Despite the best available science the USFWS turned their backs on the Northern Rockies region gray wolves Within just 60 days since the USFWS failed to relist them we are already witnessing the disturbing onset of giving the fox the key to the hen house and abandoning the farm The maltreatment is now destined to worsen for these wolves and other indiscriminate species through overt deceptive well-orchestrated secretive and legal actionsThe Biden administration and its Fish and Wildlife Service are complicit in the horrific war on wolves being waged by the states of Idaho Wyoming and Montana said George Nickas executive director of Wilderness Watch Idaho is fighting to open airstrips all over the backcountry including in designated Wilderness to get more hunters to wipe out wolves in their most remote hideouts Montana is resorting to night hunting and shooting over bait and Wyoming has simply declared an open season Its unfortunate that citizens have to turn to the courts but it seems that like their state counterparts federal officials have lost all reverence or respect for these iconic wilderness animalsSince wolves began re-establishing in western states after the indiscriminate killing of the 19th and 20th centuries US citizens have had the opportunity to directly observe wolves in these incredible landscapes we are privileged to share said Jeff Juel forest policy director of Friends of the Clearwater And in understanding the wolf as our wild relative in this community of life we urge the Fish and Wildlife Service to reject the primitive fear-based impulses some states exhibit with their regressive management,Idaho Montana Wyoming De-listing Hunting Protections NGO Recovery Endangered Species Act Wolf Gray Wolves,Public/Private,Dr Robert Crabtree and others ,A 2023 study (https://wwwcabidigitallibraryorg/doi/1031220/agriRxiv202300215) by Dr Robert Crabtree and others found the Montana state population model was badly biased overestimating total wolf populations by as

We hope Governor Gordon isnt prioritizing reelection over doing the right thingHeinous acts like those of Cody Roberts are a direct consequence of delisting wolves and turning management of wolves over to the states 85% of Wyoming is designated as a predator zone allowing for the unrestricted killing of wolves and other predator-classified animals This violates the terms of delisting wolves from the ESA If anything proves they have not acted in good faith it is their attempted cover-up of Cody Roberts brutal acts In response to a public records request WGFD finally released Cody Roberts name and videos of the injured muzzled wolf cowering in the bar full of people who did nothing about it WGFD Director Nesvik Issued an excuse of a heavy workload for the delay of releasing informationAll conservation efforts are important The effectiveness of national monuments to protect species like wolves remains uncertain however Hunting and trapping are permitted in most existing monuments Perhaps that is because it is incredibly difficult to create a monument under the Antiquities Act and the only way to gain the necessary support has been to allow hunting trapping and livestock grazingUltimately ensuring the protection of vulnerable species like wolves requires comprehensive conservation strategies including stronger regulation enforcement and reconsideration of management responsibilities Relisting wolves under the Endangered Species Act is necessary to address the shortcomings of state management and prevent further harm to these iconic animalsThats why Footloose Montana is joining other wildlife conservation organizations to sue the Department of the Interior and the US Fish and Wildlife Service to relist wolves Wyoming Montana and Idaho have shown they cannot be trusted when it comes to sustaining wolves and other rare and sensitive species,Wyoming Endangered Species List,NGO,Jessica Karjala Footloose Montana,Ultimately ensuring the protection of vulnerable species like wolves requires comprehensive conservation strategies including stronger regulation enforcement and reconsideration of management responsibilities Relisting wolves under the Endangered Species Act is necessary to address the shortcomings of state management and prevent further harm to these iconic animalsThats why Footloose Montana is joining other wildlife conservation organizations to sue the Department of the Interior and the US Fish and Wildlife Service to relist wolves Wyoming Montana and Idaho have shown they cannot be trusted when it comes to sustaining wolves and other rare and sensitive species

5,Idaho Capital Sun - States Newsroom: Biden administration seeks to remove gray wolf protections in Lower 48,Y,11/21/2024,After,Idaho Capital

Montana,The Biden administration has asked a federal appeals court to reinstate a rule passed under the Trump administration to remove Endangered Species Act protections for gray wolves in the Lower 48 states (Eric Cole/US Fish and Wildlife Service) The Biden administration has asked a federal appeals court to reinstate a rule passed under the Trump administration to remove Endangered Species Act protections for gray wolves in the Lower 48 states which if successful would put the animals under state management like is currently the case in Montana and surrounding statesOn behalf of the US Fish and Wildlife Service attorneys with the US Department of Justice filed the 87-page appeal of a California district courts 2022 decision that blocked the Trump-era rule and kept existing listing regulations in place The district courts decision kept wolves in Minnesota a threatened species an endangered species in 44 states and a delisted population in Montana Idaho Wyoming eastern Oregon eastern Washington and north-central UtahNorthwest ecosystems changed dramatically when wolves were nearly exterminated study findsNorthwest ecosystems changed dramatically when wolves were nearly exterminated study finds  Idaho Capital SunThe new appeal to the Ninth Circuit US Court of Appeals said the district court incorrectly interpreted the Endangered Species Act which the government contends is only meant to ensure species are not in danger of going extinct not to restore species to their full historical rangeBut the filing has irked wolf conservation groups that have long fought in court for enhanced protections for various groups of gray wolves or the entire Lower 48 population and believe that handing all wolves over to state management will reverse decades of recoveryAt its core this appeal is about whether the purpose of the ESA is to recover endangered and threatened species to the point where they are no longer in danger of extinction or whether it goes beyond that objective to require that a species be restored to its historical range before delisting the governments appeal brief says The ESA is clear: its goal is to prevent extinction not to restore species to their pre-western settlement numbers and rangeEnvironmental groups urge US Fish and Wildlife Service to continue gray wolf recovery plansSusan Holmes the executive director of the Endangered Species Coalition called the filing bewildering and said if the circuit court sides with the government the group believes the US Fish and Wildlife Service could abandon its efforts to create a wolf recovery plan it agreed to as part of a settlement announced in February involving another wolf Endangered Species Act court caseThis faulty interpretation of the Endangered Species Act would halt wolf recovery in its tracks Holmes said in a statement We urge the Service to continue gray wolf recovery efforts and we remain committed to working with them on a vision for recoveryThe government argues in its appeal that the court substituted its own judgment for the scientific analysis done by the Fish and Wildlife Service that led to the decision to delist gray wolves The agency says it analyzed gray wolf populations in three different configurations and found that none of those configurations warranted listing them as an endangered or threatened speciesThe gray wolf is one of the ESAs biggest success stories: it has made a remarkable recovery and now thrives in the continental United States in two large expanding metapopulations that are also connected to large populations of wolves in Canada the filing says The district courts decision faulting the Services extensive recovery analysis fundamentally misunderstands the ESA the relevant science and the role of a reviewing court under the (Administrative Procedure Act)The government also argues the district court incorrectly found the Fish and Wildlife Service erred when it did not consider threats to wolves in areas of the US where they no longer exist It said the court wrongly found the agency had not considered all state and federal regulatory mechanisms surrounding wolf management when it moved to delist wolves in the Lower 48It makes no sense to require the Service to directly analyze the threat humans pose to wolves in areas where wolves do not exist the filing says In short it is pointless to separately consider whether the wolves are in danger of extinction in areas where there are no wolvesThe Fish and Wildlife Service maintains that there are two large and either stable or growing gray wolf populations in the US that number close to 5000 have high levels of genetic diversity and are resilient to threats because they can quickly reproduce and disperse across wide areas including interconnecting with an estimated 15000 wolves in CanadaThe filing says the district court incorrectly weighted threats to individual wolves instead of emphasizing the agencys analysis of the gray wolf as an entire speciesPutting a spotlight on the most vulnerable individuals of a species will always lead to the conclusion that those individuals are at risk the government wrote But that does not mean that every species is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range now or into the foreseeable futureIf gray wolves are delisted in the Lower 48 the species would still be considered sensitiveThe filing also notes that if the gray wolf is delisted across the Lower 48 the species would still be considered a sensitive species for at least five years and remain under federal regulations The government argues the district courts ruling and parameters do not align with direction on the Endangered Species Act that Congress gave to the Fish and Wildlife ServiceThe ESA does not require the Service to restore wolves to all areas where they used to be the filing says Particularly in this case such a requirement is impossible to meet given how widespread wolves used to be and the significant development in many of those areasThe appellees in the case are several conservation groups including WildEarth Guardians and the Western Watersheds Project The National Rifle Association Safari Club and State of Utah have intervened in the caseMultiple groups have also sued the federal government over its February decision not to give wolves in the West special protections as a distinct population segment and to re-list wolves in Montana Idaho and Wyoming One of those groups the Center for Biological Diversity this week said the Fish and Wildlife Services ongoing attempt to delist gray wolves in the Lower 48 is dangerousIm confident the district courts reasoned decision that reinstated wolf protections will be upheld said the organizations carnivore conservation program director Collette Adkins But Im frustrated that the agency tasked with wolf recovery is again trying to strip life-saving protections from wolves in places like
